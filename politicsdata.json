Every telephone pole in sight has snapped in half.\n\"It's very hard to explain,\" said Jason Gunderson, a member of the Cajun Navy rescue group. \"The only way I can explain it, through my eyeballs, is a Third World country war zone.\" Similar scenes are emerging across the Florida Panhandle, where Hurricane Michael left more than 350,000 without power and entire neighborhoods in ruins after hitting Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach as a powerful Category 4 storm. How to stay safe after Hurricane Michael \"It feels like a nightmare,\" Mexico Beach Councilwoman Linda Albrecht said of the catastrophic damage in her town. \"Somebody needs to come up and shake you and wake you up.\" The storm has already killed a girl in Florida and a man in Georgia. And as rescue workers sift through the debris Thursday, many fear the death toll will rise. Read More After slamming Florida and lashing Georgia, Michael is now threatening the storm-weary Carolinas. Track the storm The Carolinas are bracing for possible flooding, tornadoes and dangerous winds in many of the same areas still recovering from Hurricane Florence flooding. Michael is expected to drop 4 to 7 inches of rain from eastern Georgia to the southern mid-Atlantic and up to 9 inches of rain in isolated parts of North Carolina and Virginia, the National Hurricane Center said. \"While we will not see the full force of Hurricane Michael the way Florida will, we could see gusty winds, rain, flash flooding and even tornadoes,\" South Carolina Emergency Management Director Kim Stenson told CNN affiliate WACH. Key developments Residents rescue a couple of dogs after the storm destroyed several buildings in Panama City. \u2022 Death toll rises: At least two people have been killed in storm-related incidents since Wednesday. \u2022 No power, no internet: More than 500,000 customers remain without electricity in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. \u2022 Where is Michael? As of early Thursday morning, the storm is about 30 miles west of Augusta, Georgia, and is heading toward the northeast before it goes off into the Atlantic. \u2022 Looters arrested: Arrests have been made after reports of looting in Bay County, Florida, US Rep. Neal Dunn said. 'I just need to know he's OK' Uprooted trees, downed power poles and limited access to communications have become challenges for first responders and families trying to reach residents in need. Family awaits word on missing loved ones Megan McCall says her brother Jeff and his family were riding out the storm in the Panhandle. No one has heard from them since Wednesday afternoon. Her brother was able to tell a friend that his home was starting to get cracks in the walls and water was rushing in Wednesday. A neighbor told McCall that all the docks in the area were destroyed and many people are stuck in their homes as the roads have been blocked with debris. \"I just need to know he's OK,\" McCall said. \"If the house and the cars are destroyed they can be replaced, but my niece needs her dad -- and as much as I sometimes can't stand him, I would do anything to just know he's OK.\" In Wakulla County, the sheriff's office made a list of people who decided to ride out the storm and will begin the process of checking on them Thursday, sheriff's captain Chris Savary said. An 11-year-old girl was killed in Seminole County, Georgia. A metal carport was picked up by the wind and crashed through a roof, hitting the girl's head, said Travis Brooks, the county's emergency management director. Brooks said several hours passed before emergency officials could reach the unincorporated area where the girl was killed. And in Greensboro, Florida, a man died Wednesday after a tree fell on a home, the Gadsden County Sheriff's Office said. Military base affected On the Florida Panhandle, wind gusts blew off roofs and knocked down brick walls. Their store's grand opening was this week. Hurricane Michael left it in ruins Rob Golding opened up his home to some of his neighbors whose homes were heavily damaged. Some were inside their homes when they saw their roofs fly away, he said. \"My home was built in 1962 (and) is the only one with a solid roof left,\" Golding said. \"My mother, who passed two years ago, she put a lot of money in this house. I asked her to keep her hands on it today, and she did.\" \"It looks like a tornado came through here,\" he said. Military families are among the thousands who evacuated before the storm and won't be able to return home immediately. Officials at the Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City said dozens of trees and power lines went down, and several buildings lost their roofs across the military base. They said it could take weeks before it's safe for personnel and their families to return. Effect of climate change Michael's strength may reflect the effect of climate change on storms. The planet has warmed significantly over the past several decades, causing changes in the environment. Hurricane Michael isn't truly a 'natural disaster' Human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere create an energy imbalance, with more than 90% of remaining heat trapped by the gases going into the oceans, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. There's evidence of higher sea surface temperature and atmospheric moisture, experts say. While we might not get more storms in a warmer climate, most studies show storms will get stronger and produce more rain. Storm surge is worse now than it was 100 years ago, thanks to the rise in sea levels. According to Climate Central, a scientific research organization, the coming decades are expected to bring hurricanes that intensify more rapidly, should there be no change in the rate of greenhouse gas emissions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/js/lib/vendor/pym/pym.v1.min.js", "https://wach.com/news/local/mcmaster-sc-remains-in-state-of-emergency-due-to-hurricane-michael-florence-effects"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "linda albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason gunderson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "cajun navy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "panhandle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "callaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida panhandle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T15:18:43.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b97d33caa824ccc038d0a1d225d9efc53d73ade8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQKyQz5P_300Wa2Ut8hMzyMbYfRXtNS0f1mYYJgu2dWV6", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Soyuz rocket heading to ISS makes emergency landing", "title_full": "Soyuz rocket heading to ISS makes emergency landing - CNN", "published": "2018-10-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181011102352-01-soyuz-rocket-1011-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3404, "comments": 794, "shares": 1261}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b97d33caa824ccc038d0a1d225d9efc53d73ade8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQKyQz5P_300Wa2Ut8hMzyMbYfRXtNS0f1mYYJgu2dWV6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Smith-Spark", "published": "2018-10-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Soyuz rocket heading to ISS makes emergency landing", "text": "(CNN) Astronauts on board a Soyuz rocket heading to the International Space Station survived an emergency landing following a booster failure, a Russian space official said Thursday.\n\"The crew landed,\" Dmitry Rogozin, director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said on Twitter. \"All are alive.\" The rocket was transporting NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin of Roscosmos for a six-month stay on the ISS.

Dramatic footage showed the capsule carrying the crew as it parachuted back to Earth before thumping down in a plume of dust in Kazakhstan, about 250 miles away from where it took off. The rocket had launched minutes earlier, at 4:40 a.m. ET, from the country's Baikonur Cosmodrome on a journey that was expected to involve four orbits of the Earth and take six hours. The Soyuz-FG rocket booster blasts off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft and crew. The Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft was able to separate from the Soyuz-FG rocket booster after the issue emerged, NASA said, and began a ballistic descent. A ballistic descent is a sharper angle of landing compared to normal, the space agency said.

Michael is expected to intensify even more as it continues to head toward the Gulf Coast. Michael, which is spinning in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to make landfall Wednesday afternoon in the Florida Panhandle still a Category 3 storm. It is threatening dangerous storm surges to low-lying areas ill-equipped to handle them. Officials urged people to get out of the way now. Gov. Rick Scott called Michael a \"monstrous storm\" that could bring \"total devastation.\" \"Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades,\" Scott said. Read More \"You cannot hide from storm surge, so ... get out if an evacuation is ordered,\" he said. Michael will be the strongest hurricane to hit the continental US in more than a year Winds of tropical storm force will be felt in the area starting early Wednesday, and mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders already have been issued in at least 22 counties on the Florida Gulf Coast. Live updates About 3.7 million people were under hurricane warnings in the Panhandle and Big Bend regions, as well as parts of southeastern Alabama and southern Georgia. Tropical storm warnings cover 8.5 million people in four states. Michael was moving at 12 mph, almost 300 miles south of Panama City, Florida and 435 miles southwest of Apalachichola, Florida, as of 4 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said. Track the storm The main threats The storm's center and where it makes landfall with its destructive winds represent just one of several concerns. Among them: \u2022 Life-threatening storm surges could slam the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend and Nature Coast, with the deadliest storm surge of possibly 9 to 13 feet expected between Mexico Beach and Keaton Beach. \"That means the water will come miles in shore and could easily be over the roofs of houses,\" Scott said. The anatomy of a hurricane \u2022 Heavy rain and flooding are expected not just for Florida but also for other parts of the Southeast. Up to 12 inches of rain could fall in Florida's Panhandle and Big Bend, southeastern Alabama and southern Georgia, while parts of the Carolinas -- recently deluged by Hurricane Florence -- and southern Virginia eventually could see up to 6 inches, the hurricane center said. \u2022 Tornadoes could spawn in the Southeast on Tuesday night into Thursday, forecasters said. \u2022 Damaging winds are expected to rake not just Florida but also southeastern Alabama and southern Georgia. If Michael's core comes ashore as a Category 2 or higher, it would be the strongest storm in terms of wind speed to make landfall in the country this year. \"You will see damage to infrastructure. You will see power outages,\" said Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of Response and Recovery. #HurricaneMichael isn't heading to any one town...\nThere are warnings for more than 300 miles of coastline.

US Rep. Neal Dunn, whose district includes Panama City, urged people under evacuation orders to get out before tropical-storm-force winds arrived. He focused on islands off the coast whose bridges may close as the storm approaches. \"You haven't got anywhere to go (if the bridges close),\" he said Tuesday morning. \"And then you're riding it out in your car instead of something else.

He added that he's friends with many Democrats who are going to vote for Republicans. \"The main base of the Democrats have shifted so far left, that we'll end up being Venezuela. This country would end up being Venezuela,\" Trump said. Republicans, after a coordinated defense of Kavanaugh before his confirmation, have already pivoted to a coordinated defense of their majorities, seeking to paint those who loudly opposed Kavanaugh as part of a \"mob.\" Mobs at the gate Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both used the term over the weekend, trying to dismiss the opposition to their guy as the feeling of a few, loud protesters. \"In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob,\" Trump said at a rally in Kansas on Saturday. JUST WATCHED Trump: Democrats have turned into 'angry mob' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nTrump: Democrats have turned into 'angry mob' 01:45 Whether painting protesters as a subset of unruly partisans is accurate or will be effective is very much up for debate. But the loud protests on Capitol Hill against Kavanaugh were unlike anything seen on Capitol Hill, perhaps, since 2010, when Democrats staked their majorities on passing Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and the tea party conservatives rose up to make their anger known. Democrats are hoping something similar happens in the wake of Kavanaugh. A message that was already focused on defending that health care legislation will now also turn very much on the justice who tapped a raw nerve with the #MeToo movement. Republicans have a new name for Democrats: 'mob' There is evidence that the court, which is usually a more motivating issue for Republicans, could drive Democrats to the polls this year. In a late-September Pew Poll completed before Kavanaugh's confirmation, 76% said the Supreme Court was \"very important\" -- the first time in years the economy did not top the poll. As CNN's Grace Sparks wrote in September , more Democrats (81%) said it was \"an important issue for their vote\" than Republicans (72%). The most-referenced important issue for Republicans was the economy, which drew 85% of their registered voters. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats said that health care was the issue most on their minds. Look for new polling to see if Kavanaugh's confirmation compounds the anger of Democrats. Now that the court has that conservative majority, will it still be such a key issue for conservatives? This is a question to be answered in one month. But McConnell would love for Trump to get more nominees. He bucked his own standard in 2016 when Republicans unilaterally sat on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland and said over the weekend there would be nothing to keep Republicans from pushing through another nominee, even in 2020, if a vacancy came open. Republicans promise pro-Kavanaugh message against Trump-state Democrats Politics in midterms is a state- and district-based endeavor, not really a national one. While the House majority seems very much in play for Democrats, the Senate map greatly favors Republicans. Most of the contested seats involve Democrats running for re-election in states won by Trump and so presumably are more open to Kavanaugh. Only one of those senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voted for Kavanaugh, saying it was in the best interests of his state and the desire of his constituents. The rest of the Trump-state Democrats -- even seriously endangered incumbents like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, sided with the party, and Republicans made clear over the weekend they will exploit that vote. Key Republican votes are either retiring (Jeff Flake of Arizona) or are not up for reelection until 2020 (Susan Collins of Maine) or 2022 (Lisa Murkowski of Alaska).

I think it was the right thing to do. But we're trying to win seats.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, who turned into a pro-Kavanaugh attack dog for the GOP during the hearings and after, said he will set aside a longstanding commitment to not campaign against sitting Democratic senators. \"I've never campaigned against a colleague in my life,\" Graham said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"That's about to change. I'm going to go throughout this country to let people in these purple states, red states where Trump won know what I thought, know what I think, about this process.\" The South Carolina senator was referring to allegations from him and other Republicans that Democrats tried to slow-walk Kavanaugh's nomination and that they held allegations against him to pop just before the vote. Kavanaugh also joined in on this conspiracy theory, saying it was revenge for his work against the Clintons. Kavanaugh backlash could help Democrats There's no evidence of a conspiracy, but the allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, which the judge has vehemently denied, did emerge after his initial confirmation hearing, prolonging the process, causing a painful national conversation about who to believe -- Kavanaugh or his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford -- and making him the most tainted new justice since Clarence Thomas in 1991. A year later, a wave of new women senators took office and their ascension -- now known as the \"Year of the Woman\" -- is partially credited to backlash against the treatment of Anita Hill when she raised alarms about Clarence Thomas, alleging he sexually harassed her. Even before Kavanaugh's nomination, there were rumblings of a new \"Year of the Woman\" as a record number of women are running for office.

John Kasich, a Republican who has kept Trump at arm's length, was also disgusted by the Kavanaugh process , but for a different reason. \"I think the whole process -- look, it's both sides.

He's tried to fill the middle ground space heading into 2020, and he told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" Sunday that nobody -- Republican or Democrat -- comes out of the bloody Kavanaugh battle looking good. \"People in the country are appalled,\" said Kasich. \"That's because it's like, I got to win, and you got to lose.\" As Democrats and Republicans try to capitalize before November, Kasich said he thinks there will be Democratic pickups and maybe a new House majority, but they're moving too far left for the country. He argued there's something larger at stake. \"Look, sometimes, you can have a short-term win, and the long term, you have to wonder about the soul of our country,\" he said.

She hasn't seen him since.\nSince then, officials and journalists have scrambled to piece together the story of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, a former Saudi royal insider who became a critic of the regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkish authorities have privately said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate, a startling allegation that is firmly denied by the Saudis. Closed-circuit television footage, flight trackers, intercepted communications and even rumors of a bone saw have served as pieces of a puzzle that has spurred a diplomatic outcry. In the latest developments on Wednesday, Turkish security officials concluded that the \"highest levels of the royal court\" in Saudi Arabia ordered the assassination of Khashoggi, according to a senior official cited by The New York Times . Turkish officials have said that a 15-person team flew from Saudi Arabia into Istanbul on the day Khashoggi entered the consulate, and they have provided information about two private planes that, they say, were involved in the transit of these Saudis. Aviation data analyzed by CNN backs up evidence of the planes' arrival in Istanbul. Read More The official Quote: d by the New York Times described the operation as \"quick and complex,\" and that Khashoggi was killed within two hours of his arrival at the consulate. The agents \"dismembered his body with a bone saw they brought for the purpose,\" the official told The New York Times. \"It's like 'Pulp Fiction,'\" he added. About the only thing that is known for sure about Khashoggi's fate is that he was last seen at 1:14 p.m. local time last Tuesday as he entered the consulate. His disappearance has prompted calls for investigations from around the world. The kingdom's staunchest Western allies, including the United States, where Khashoggi had applied for permanent residency, have urged Saudi Arabia to come clean. Trump said Wednesday that he's been in touch with the \"highest levels\" of the Saudi government about Khashoggi's case and expressed concerns about his possible murder. He said his administration was pressing the Saudi government to reveal more about the incident. \"We're demanding everything. We want to see what's going on here. It's a bad situation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. But he stopped short of saying whether he believed the Saudis have knowledge about his whereabouts, or may have played a role in his disappearance, stating that not enough was known to make a determination. People hold posters of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi during a protest organized by members of the Turkish-Arabic Media Association at the entrance to the Saudi Arabia Consulate on October 5, 2018 in Istanbul. Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, told CNN that although she is afraid that media reports of his death could be true, she wants to wait for a \"final result\" and still thinks \"anything\" could have happened to him. A murder mystery? Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied Turkey's account of the story, saying that Khashoggi left the embassy on the same day he arrived. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, a Saudi official said the kingdom \"categorically\" denies \"any involvement in Jamal's disappearance.\" \"At this stage, our priority is to support the investigation, as opposed to responding to evolving comments not directly related to those efforts. Jamal's well-being, as a Saudi citizen, is our utmost concern and we are focusing on the investigation as a means to reveal the truth behind his disappearance. Our sympathies go out to the family during this difficult time,\" the official said.

A friend of the journalist, Turan Kislakci, who is also the head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association, told CNN that Turkish officials called him and \"offered their condolences and told us to be ready for a funeral.\" On Wednesday, a senior Turkish official speaking on the condition of anonymity told CNN that \"the Saudis are not cooperating fully with the investigation. They are not open to cooperating.\" In addition, Saudi authorities have asked Turkish authorities to postpone the search of their consulate in Istanbul, Turkey's pro-government daily Yeni Safak reported, citing anonymous security sources. The newspaper report did not mention a reason for the Saudis' request. Saudi Arabia had earlier said it would allow Turkish authorities to search the consulate on the request of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, the newspaper said. CNN reached out to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by phone for comment. The person who answered the phone said that \"the Saudi consulate does not have a comment\" on the request for a delay, and hung up. US officials are also attempting to piece together what happened, in particular whether any operation to silence Khashoggi was ordered at the highest levels of the Saudi government, including bin Salman. One US official told CNN that the US is examining communications intercepts to see if it can learn any more about what may have happened. US officials think it's possible the crown prince wanted Khashoggi silenced, but miscalculated the global impact his disappearance would have. The Washington Post -- for which Khashoggi wrote critical columns -- said US intelligence intercepted communications of Saudi officials discussing a plan to capture the journalist. Citing a person familiar with the information, the Post said the Saudis wanted to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and lay hands on him there. It was not clear whether the Saudis intended to arrest and interrogate Khashoggi or to kill him, or if the United States warned Khashoggi that he was a target, the source told the Post. CCTV cameras CCTV footage in and around the premises of the consulate have emerged as a focal point of the inquiry into Khashoggi's fate. CCTV image of Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2. A CCTV image obtained by CNN showed the missing Saudi journalist entering the Saudi consulate at lunchtime on October 2. Cengiz waited outside, and says he never emerged. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has demanded that the Saudis back up their claims that Khashoggi left the embassy alive by producing CCTV evidence. Such evidence has yet to emerge. On Tuesday, The Guardian newspaper reported that the consulate's Turkish staff were told to take a day off the day Khashoggi disappeared. It also reported that Turkish investigators believe security footage from inside the consulate was removed and taken back to Saudi Arabia on a private jet. During a tour of the six-story consulate given to journalists on Saturday, Saudi Consul General Mohammad al-Otaibi told Reuters that while the consulate was equipped with cameras, they did not record footage of Khashoggi entering or leaving the building. A 15-man murder squad? Turkish investigators have been focusing on the arrival of 15 Saudis in Istanbul last Tuesday. A Turkish police statement, Quote: d by state news agency Anadolu, said that the group of Saudis, who included several government officials, visited the consulate while Khashoggi was there. Two executive jets belonging to a Riyadh-based company that does government contracting and corporate work were probably involved in ferrying the Saudis to Istanbul, according to a source familiar with the timing and route of the flights. Flight-tracking data also backs up evidence of the planes' arrival in Istanbul. The first flight from Riyadh arrived just after 3 a.m. local time Tuesday. The CCTV image from outside the consulate shows Khashoggi entering at 1:14 p.m. A second flight from Riyadh landed in Istanbul at 5 p.m. It left an hour later, making a stopover in Cairo before returning to Riyadh. The first flight left Istanbul at 11:00 p.m. On Wednesday, a Turkish newspaper, Sabah, published photos and names of the 15 men it said are the focus of the Turkish investigation. Sabah said it \"obtained photos of the mysterious intelligence team entering Turkey through Ataturk Airport.\" The photos alongside the names appear to have been taken from airport cameras. The Sabah report does not indicate the source of the material. CNN has not been able to independently verify Sabah's account. Police and intelligence officers searched one of the private planes before it departed Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. They also examined camera records from the day of Khashoggi's disappearance, according to Sabah. Fianc\u00e9e's agony Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e told CNN that she fears for his fate. \"He may have been kidnapped, abducted, or some harm may have come to him,\" she said in written answers to questions from CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"Images in the media point to the possibility of an abduction or an assassination. I hope that it does not turn out to be murder as alleged by these images.\" \"Until official statements are made, it makes more sense to wait a bit longer and to see the final result as oppose to making a bold comment,\" she added, saying she did not feel comfortable enough to be interviewed on camera. \"Until now no official document could be made available to prove that he did exit from there on his own,\" she said. \"it has not been proven until now through official documents that he exited of his own accord.\" Cengiz told CNN that she was questioned by Turkish investigators after Khashoggi's disappearance and has had a few calls with officials since. Saudi authorities have not contacted her, she said. Cengiz said she felt responsible for Khashoggi, and has been \"in a state of deep confusion and sadness.\" Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yemeni Tawakkol Karman holds a picture of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi during a demonstration in front of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul last Friday. One activist familiar with the events leading up to Khashoggi's entering the consulate said Saudi officials had given the journalist assurances that it would be safe for him to enter. The Saudi consulate said \"'No, don't worry about it, you're welcome here' ... So he didn't take the proper precaution,\" London-based activist Yahya Assiri told CNN. \"Some of his friends suggested that he go with a lawyer, or to let the Turkish police or intelligence know that he was going. He didn't notify anyone, just his fianc\u00e9e and he went with her and they didn't let her in,\" he added. \"So he didn't take enough precaution. He had total trust in the state.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/world/europe/jamal-khashoggi-turkey-saudi-arabia.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamal khashoggi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khashoggi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T01:50:38.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "743953782b90e45cf29f4c30815506c5063839b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQD.Euiy2kVGTDHipkHhFs4hgyE0FXOSX5btE5kaj6lPX", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi: Saudis discussed plan to lure journalist to Saudi Arabia CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Jamal Khashoggi: Saudis discussed plan to lure journalist to Saudi Arabia - CNNPolitics", "published": "2018-10-11T19:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181010124131-01-jamal-khashoggi-hatice-cengiz-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 570, "comments": 315, "shares": 605}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "743953782b90e45cf29f4c30815506c5063839b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQD.Euiy2kVGTDHipkHhFs4hgyE0FXOSX5btE5kaj6lPX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Elise Labott", "published": "2018-10-11T19:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi: Saudis discussed plan to lure journalist to Saudi Arabia CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) The US has intercepts of Saudi officials discussing a plan to lure journalist Jamal Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and detain him, according to a US official familiar with the intelligence.\nKhashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist and critic of the regime, has been missing for more than a week after going to the Saudi consulate general in Istanbul to obtain wedding papers. Turkish officials privately believe he was killed at the consulate, an allegation denied by Saudi Arabia. The official said it is unclear if the original plan was to murder Khashoggi or if something went wrong at the consulate and that he might have been killed during an attempt to kidnap him. The official said that getting Khashoggi to the consulate appears to have been a backup plan, because he couldn't be persuaded to fly back to Saudi Arabia. The official said there is no hard evidence as to whether Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, is dead or alive. Missing journalist's fianc\u00e9e 'in a state of deep confusion and sadness' The source did not say when the US became aware of the discussions. As CNN reported earlier this week, intercepted communications were being reviewed in the wake of Khashoggi's disappearance. Read More The official would not go so far as to say Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the operation but said that, although he may not have known the specifics such a plan couldn't have taken place without his approval. US officials think it's possible the Crown Prince wanted Khashoggi silenced, but miscalculated the global impact his disappearance would have. The Washington Post first reported the details of the intercepts. US President Donald Trump is facing increased pressure over the Khashoggi case. Late Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators wrote to the President, calling for the White House to determine what happened to Khashoggi and whether sanctions should be imposed on whoever was responsible for his fate. The letter, penned by the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, triggers an investigation under legislation that allows the President to impose sanctions on individuals or countries that are deemed to have committed a human rights violation. The White House must respond within 120 days, setting out what actions it proposes to take. Trump told Fox News in an interview on Wednesday night that \"so far it's looking a little bit like\" the Saudis are behind Khashoggi's disappearance but said it was too early to say how the US might respond. Blocking further arms sales to Saudi Arabia \"would be hurting us,\" he said. Trump said that US economic success was due in part to \"what we are doing with our defense systems,\" and added: \"Frankly I think that would be a very, very tough pill to swallow for our country.\" Investigation continues Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters Thursday that Turkey \"cannot remain silent\" on the disappearance of Khashoggi. \"We are currently investigating the event in all its dimensions. The event took place in our country. We cannot remain silent in the face of an event like this because it is not a normal occurrence,\" Erdogan said while returning on a flight from Hungary. He said security and intelligence forces \"have been looking at all dimensions of this\" and are looking especially closely at the country's entry and exit points.

Dramatic video from the scene showed people suddenly plunging through the pavement as it collapsed beneath them. Two victims died after being pulled from the pit and rushed to hospital, state media said. They were reportedly married only days before. Efforts to rescue the other victims, a father and his young son, were unsuccessful, with the two found dead on Tuesday afternoon. Four people were swallowed by the sinkhole when it opened up. Rescuers believed the final two were trapped around 10 meters (32 feet) underground, some two meters further than local rescuers' equipment could reach. Read More \"The biggest difficulty is that the road surface is thick with a large amount of soil,\" Gao Mingyue, a fire service official, told CCTV, earlier in the search. \"We had to move excavators to a lower place and we now have two large excavators digging out soils so that we can stand on a lower place and use the long arm excavator to dig deeper.\" Rescuers have been working around the clock since the sinkhole emerged. More than 40 firefighters were involved in the rescue effort but the search was called off after the bodies were discovered. The government still hasn't disclosed what caused the deadly sinkhole to suddenly appear. Sinkholes typically form when acidic rainwater dissolves limestone or similar rock beneath the soil, leaving a large void that collapses when it's no longer able to support the weight of what's above -- whether that be an open field, a road or a house. The cave-in area was over 10 square meters (107 sq ft), the broadcaster said. Two of the missing people are believed to be a father and his young son. \"When we arrived, the caved-in area was not big, which only covered two meters both in length and depth. But during the rescue process, it collapsed again, causing another two-meter sink. Firefighters at once evacuated while doing the rescue work,\" Gao said. The presence of high-voltage power cables and water pipes made the rescue work especially difficult. \"Given what we found in the hole, cables are crossed in a mess, including two high-tension lines, weak electric wires and gas pipelines,\" Gao added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gao mingyue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cctv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dazhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sichuan province", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-09T13:42:10.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3113c37dd69ce954e2d409a56a39ee1506386d7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJe03RFJYIhAEFG4ZHYVv3ifPgAGTASQvHmRBGX9f3ErmA--", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_us.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "McCarthy plans bill to fully fund Trump's border wall CNNPolitics", "title_full": "McCarthy plans bill to fully fund Trump's border wall - CNNPolitics", "published": "2018-10-10T18:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180619205223-trump-gop-congress-meeting-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2458, "comments": 1150, "shares": 546}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3113c37dd69ce954e2d409a56a39ee1506386d7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJe03RFJYIhAEFG4ZHYVv3ifPgAGTASQvHmRBGX9f3ErmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Elizabeth Landers", "published": "2018-10-10T18:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "McCarthy plans bill to fully fund Trump's border wall CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy plans to introduce legislation this week that will fully fund President Donald Trump's proposed wall along the US-Mexico border with a whopping $23.4 billion price tag, a spokesperson for the California Republican told CNN on Tuesday.\nThe bill is still in the drafting process but is expected to be released within the next few days in the pro-forma session this week. The House remains in recess until mid-November, after the midterm elections, so the body would not consider the legislation for another month or so. Even with a Republican-controlled Capitol Hill and White House, any proposal to fully fund Trump's signature campaign pledge of a border wall would have a difficult pathway to passing both chambers of Congress, given the threshold for such legislation and the narrow margin of control in the Senate. The legislation comes as McCarthy is headed to the US-Mexico border on Wednesday for a tour and briefing by the Department of Homeland Security and as the California congressman continues to push to succeed Speaker Paul Ryan when the Wisconsin Republican departs in January. Mccarthy is not the only House Republican to express interest in leading the caucus. Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and House Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan of Ohio have talked about pursuing the top House GOP spot , and both are traditionally affiliated with the more conservative side of the caucus members. Scalise has said he would not run to lead the party if McCarthy does, but Jordan has already announced his intention to seek the position . McCarthy, who has allied himself closely with Trump in the last two years , is working on the border wall bill by himself at this point, with no cosponsors. Read More \"This is priority for both Kevin and the President,\" the spokesperson told CNN. McCarthy's proposal was first reported by Breitbart . The legislation will include other policy measures popular with hardline immigration hawks, including several that have already passed the House. This includes Kate's Law , the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, the Criminal Gang Alien Gang Member Removal Act and two other House resolutions that passed this year. Those measures have languished in the Senate, where Republicans control 51 votes in a chamber where the vast majority of legislation needs a minimum of 60 senators in support to advance. Democrats have almost unanimously opposed those measures. Congress is trying to run away from immigration. This fall may not let them. Money for the border wall has been among the most contentious issues in funding negotiations between Democrats and Republicans for Trump's entire time in office. In an omnibus spending deal that was signed into law in March was $1.6 billion in border security, which includes millions for 33 miles of new border fencing -- not a concrete wall -- that was already authorized through the 2006 Secure Fence Act. As the legislation is still being written, it's not clear if McCarthy's proposal of a $23.4 billion package would have any element of the wall paid for by Mexico, as Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail. More border wall money from the US will have to go through the appropriations bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security. It's one of the bills the House of Representatives didn't finish on time before September 30, leaving it funded at the previous year's levels until December 7. Aides in both chambers, in both parties, think the fight over wall funding levels after the election could lead to a government shutdown -- something Trump himself has advocated as part of a negotiating strategy. Ryan previewed the possibility of a border wall fight during comments to reporters on Monday in Washington. \"Yes, we intend on having a full-fledged discussion about how to complete this mission of securing our border, and we will have a big fight about that,\" he said. \"What that fight looks like ... we have a commitment to go fight for securing the border and getting these policy objectives achieved. And we're going to be looking at doing it. We'll figure out how to do it in December.\" Even if the bill passed the House, it would need 60 votes to clear the Senate, an unlikely threshold to reach considering Democrats' vocal opposition to the President's border wall.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/10/09/kevin-mccarthy-introducing-bill-fully-fund-border-wall-midterm-immigration-referendum/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin mccarthy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mccarthy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T02:11:29.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91b251af2307900783a9dc6db1fd62e8e212b051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQOdgykGo1XRVGw3QpWk_csd53jtWJurfLLiQaRoOyWfi", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "World Mental Health Day: After many suicide attempts, ex-footballer marvels at miraculous survival - CNN", "title_full": "World Mental Health Day: After many suicide attempts, ex-footballer marvels at miraculous survival - CNN", "published": "2018-10-10T17:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.248, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181009163747-clarke-carlisle-tease-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1104, "comments": 169, "shares": 430}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91b251af2307900783a9dc6db1fd62e8e212b051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQOdgykGo1XRVGw3QpWk_csd53jtWJurfLLiQaRoOyWfi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dominic Rech", "published": "2018-10-10T17:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "World Mental Health Day: After many suicide attempts, ex-footballer marvels at miraculous survival - CNN", "text": "Lancashire (CNN) It started with a feeling of isolation, of not wanting to engage with the world.

Gripped by anxiety and a fear of impending doom there was a sense everything was about to fall apart and that he was powerless to do anything about it. Nonetheless, if his world was going to collapse, it was going to collapse on his own terms. That was in late 2014, when former footballer Clarke Carlisle came very close to ending his life. \"How can I sit here in front of you and say that four years ago, I put myself in front of a 10-ton lorry, at 60 miles an hour and I didn't break a single bone in my body,\" Carlisle told CNN Sport at his home in Preston.

'Britain's brainiest footballer' A former English Premier League footballer, Carlisle played for clubs including Preston, Burnley, Watford in a career spanning 17 years. The 38-year-old was once dubbed \"Britain's brainiest footballer,\" even appearing on the mentally bamboozling British game show \"Countdown\" -- he won, taking home the show's famous teapot trophy. He says the suicide attempt in 2014 was a turning point for him, but his struggle with depression has persisted and about a year ago, in September 2017, he was reported missing, only to be discovered on the streets of Liverpool. \"I was intent on taking my own life,\" says Carlisle, who shatters the idea that footballers lead cushioned and painless lives, unperturbed by the challenges that affect everyday human beings. \"I was wandering around the streets of Liverpool, wondering what's the best place for me to die.\" He was looking for the most practical way to die. How would he want his wife to find him? What about the first responders? And how would his suicide impact witnesses who found him? \"I was thinking about a responsible way to die. It was that procrastination that allowed a couple of passersby to intervene,\" he said. After his return to safety, Lancashire police thanked members of the public for sharing a missing persons appeal. Former footballer, Clarke Carlisle, outside his home in Preston, Lancashire.

With the help of therapy he was able to pinpoint the inception of his depression to 2001, during a period in his career where he had picked up a bad knee injury. Clarke said injuries were one of the \"triggers\" for the worsening mental health of footballers. It's a view supported by a 2015 study organized by the World Players' Union FIFPro, which found that professional footballers who had sustained three or more severe injuries during their career were two to nearly four times more likely to report mental health problems than those who had not suffered from severe injuries. Clarke Carlisle in action playing for Northampton Town in 2012. As he looks back on his each of his suicide attempts, Carlisle says that they comprised a two-three month descent and ranged from locking himself away to being actively suicidal. Now, he puts emphasis on self-awareness and understanding himself -- managing his mental health with the love and support of his family. When you're injured, you can't play and that creates \"a feeling of worthlessness,\" says Carlisle. Other triggers for players can include transferring to another club or having to retire. \"You go from being fundamentally needed to obsolete, which in football usually happens at the age of 33 or 35,\" added Carlisle. \"There are many, many things that can contribute to a player's downward spiral in football and we need to be able to mitigate the impact.\" FIFPro's 2015 research also showed that 38% of players and 35% of former players reported from suffering from symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.

Kirkland told CNN Sport about the troubles he faced with his mental health after leaving Wigan in 2012, which he saw as the most successful period in his career. A period he didn't want to leave behind. \"It was a big, big blow for me, I was devastated. Everybody suffers from mental health. Once you start going down that road, it's very difficult to get out of it -- it sort of spirals out of control before you know it.\" Kirkland thinks real progress has only been a recent development. \"It's only really been over the last two or three years things have been moving forward but before that there was nothing there. Especially when I was growing up and during a lot of my career.\" Chris Kirkland captured during a game against Bolton Wanderers in 2009 READ: What next for football's 'weird' social media? Is 2018 a year of progress? According to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), the body which represents all footballers in England and Wales, by the end of August 2018, 312 football players had reached out for mental health support. That compares with only 160 players in 2016 and 403 in 2017. Michael Bennett, the head of player welfare at the PFA, turned to a career in counseling after struggling with depression during long spells of injury as a professional footballer. \"The seed was sown then, in terms of the work I do now. Although, I don't see it as work, I see it as a calling. I played football for 20 years, it's an emotional roller coaster but what I do now far outweighs any buzz I got as being a professional footballer.\" The PFA runs a 24-hour helpline for current and former players, offers a network of counselors operating to offer with emotional and mental support and is now rolling out mental health workshops to all 92 league clubs. Kirkland praised the work of the PFA and is, himself, currently involved in the creation of a mental health app, designed to offer emotional support to people across society. The work of the PFA, is being complimented by a partnership between the English Football League (EFL), which runs the three divisions outside the Premier League, and the mental health charity, Mind. An image promoting the two-year partnership between Mind and the English football league in 2018. During the 2018/19 season Mind's logo appears on the back of the shirts of all the 72 clubs that make up the EFL. \"We're only a few weeks in but already the response has been phenomenal,\" said Hayley Jarvis, head of physical activity at Mind, who is also taking a lead in the partnership. \"We want this to have a lasting impact, and have a positive conversation about mental health, particularly with men. Six thousand suicides a year and 75% of them are men.\" She says the charity has plans to work with every EFL club -- both on a local and national level -- all with the aim of promoting awareness and breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health. \"One in four of us have a mental health problem every year -- so for us, we are getting that message out there and trying to tackle taboos. It is OK to be not OK,\" she said. \"I think the fact we have the Mind logo as such a prominent feature on the back of the clubs shirts, that's really good to get that conversation started about mental health.\" Marvin Sordell, who plays for Burton Albion, has also talked openly about his struggle with depression.

For Carlisle, all these steps are positive, but he thinks football as a whole has huge potential to go even further. \"Football is our national sport, it's ubiquitous,\" Carlisle said. \"The record number of people who watch the game and the power of the medium is incredible. \"Football has the finances and the powers of leadership to be able to create a template of support that can be then translated into any other industry in the world. \"Not only can they be flag-bearers and leaders but [football] can underpin a mental health revolution by creating the template that other industries use.

Erdogan said the Saudi consulate should have CCTV cameras and should be able to show the video of Khashoggi leaving the building. He mentioned that there are no documents or evidence that show the journalist departing. The Justice Ministry and the chief prosecutor in Istanbul \"started an investigation and efforts are continuing,\" Erdogan said. Airport entrances and exits are being investigated. \"At the moment there are certain people who arrived from Saudi Arabia. And our chief investigator is investigating everything in this matter.\" Read More Turkey has asked for permission to search the consulate in Istanbul in the wake of Khashoggi's disappearance, state broadcaster TRT said. That move comes as Turkey also summoned Saudi ambassador Sedat Onal for a second time in recent days on Sunday, asking the diplomat for his \"full cooperation\" in the investigation. These are the latest developments in Turkey's probe into the disappearance of Khashoggi, a Washington Post writer and Saudi royal court insider-turned-critic. Turkish officials told several media organizations that he had been murdered inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia has strenuously denied any involvement in Khashoggi's disappearance. Khashoggi, who left Saudia Arabia in 2017, entered the building on Tuesday to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fianc\u00e9e waited outside. But she says she never saw him re-emerge. A Saudi official said Khashoggi left the consulate shortly after he visited. The Saudis did not, however, release any surveillance footage or other evidence. Activist Tawakkol Karman holds a picture of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi during a demonstration in front of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on Friday. The incident has thrown sharp focus on Saudi Arabia's young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's perceived crackdown on dissidents, his kingdom's delicate relationship with Turkey, and Khashoggi 's influence within the royal court. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday called Khashoggi a \"friend\" he had known for some time, and vowed to personally \"chase\" the investigation into his disappearance. Turkish police are also examining all the consulate's entry and exit records, from the time Khashoggi entered the building until his fianc\u00e9e lost contact with him. Turkish officials: Khashoggi was killed in consulate Four days after Khashoggi vanished, unnamed Turkish officials told the The Washington Post and Reuters that the journalist was killed inside the consulate. The officials have so far provided no evidence or details of how they arrived at this conclusion. Yasin Aktay, a political adviser to Erdogan, told CNN on Sunday that he too believes there is a strong possibility that Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate. \"I personally think the possibility of him being killed is stronger than other possibilities, although I do not want to accept it. Because if he was alive, Saudis would provide evidence that he is alive,\" Aktay told CNN during a telephone interview in Istanbul. \"If he is not in the consulate and if he did not leave through the normal ways, he might have left sedated or left in pieces.\" Aktay, who is also an adviser to the ruling AK Party, told CNN that said the Turkish government is not \"ignoring any piece of evidence,\" and said the Saudis are not \"sharing any convincing explanations on what happened inside the building.\" JUST WATCHED Jamal Khashoggi's editor speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nJamal Khashoggi's editor speaks out 07:42 Fifteen Saudi Arabian nationals -- including several officials -- arrived in Istanbul on two planes and visited the Saudi consulate there on the day Khashoggi went missing, state-run Anadolu news agency reported Saturday, citing police sources. The 15 Saudis have all since left Turkey, it added. As demands for answers grew, Saudi officials gave journalists a tour Saturday of the six-story building in an effort to prove Khashoggi was not inside. Reuters said that a consular official showed them every room, even opening up cupboards and filing cabinets. No sign of him was found. On Sunday, Khashoggi's family in Saudi Arabia appeared to distance themselves from media reports of his death, saying in a statement to the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel: \"We trust the government and the actions taken by it and all the efforts being made in the case of Jamal Khashoggi.\" Who is Jamal Khashoggi? Khashoggi, known in part for his interviews with terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, was a Saudi royal court insider before he left Saudi Arabia in 2017 for Washington. He began to contribute opinion pieces to The Washington Post that were critical of bin Salman's policies, including his consolidation of power. He was named a contributing writer at the Post in January. Powerful: @washingtonpost have printed a blank space where Jamal Khashoggi's column should be, after his disappearance.

The first Chinese official to be reach the top of Interpol, Meng's appointment just two years ago had been seen as a victory for Beijing and was widely celebrated in state media. \"You've got the head of Interpol being arrested at home on corruption, so that's pretty embarrassing,\" Richard McGregor, senior fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute, told CNN. \"Secondly it just displays, on a wide screen, all the problems with China's domestic political system and how that plays out in the rest of the world when the two are lined up against each other.\" Read More Unusually, the statement released by the Chinese government confirming Meng had been detained under suspicion of corruption didn't just mention the charges. It also stressed the importance of loyalty to both Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Party's leadership. Head of Interpol Meng Hongwei accused of corruption, Chinese government says Michael Caster, human rights advocate with Safeguard Defenders, told CNN he found the wording of the Chinese statement \"really alarming.\" \"I think it's very concerning (that) China thinks it can abduct and arbitrarily detain the sitting head of an international organization without serious consequences,\" said Caster. \"Not only is it pointing out the supposed criminal violation, its ... emphasizing that ultimately Meng Hongwei was serving at the discretion of the Communist Party, which is headed by Xi Jinping,\" added Caster. 'An extension of the party' Meng's disappearance is just the latest high-profile arrest in Xi's long running anti-corruption campaign, now orchestrated by the powerful National Supervision Commission (NSC). Top security officials, leading politicians and military generals have all fallen foul of anti-corruption inspectors, which was originally intended to capture both \"tigers and flies\" -- members of the Party elite once considered untouchable, as well as regular Chinese citizens. Fan Bingbing's disappearance shows no one is safe from Beijing During Xi's six-year tenure, it's estimated over a million officials have been punished. Critics however have suggested that the campaign is simply another tool by which Xi can remove political opponents. Officially legislated in March, the NSC is a strengthened version of the original Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), with sweeping terms of references which extend its disciplinary reach outside the Communist Party. \"The party is not responsive to the outside world and its only responsive internally. (Meng's arrest) shows the NSC for what it is, an extension of the Party, not a government ministry which embodies greater legal protections,\" McGregor said. Even before it was beefed up the anti-corruption campaign had multiple, high-profile victims -- rising political star Sun Zhengcai , senior general Guo Boxiong and security tzar Zhou Yongkang. China rebuts Western criticism Chinese state media tabloid Global Times objected strongly to Western reporting of Meng's detention, saying foreign media had \"refused to understand\" Chinese law. \"The Western media's brouhaha stems from their disrespect for Chinese law and misunderstanding of China's anti-corruption campaign. Wherever China's legal system differs from the West's, they arrogantly regard such differences as flaws,\" the editorial said. But McGregor said while China was not alone in putting domestic matters ahead of international concerns, it was the Chinese government's methods which raised warning signals. \"The issue here is not just domestic issues trumping everything else, but it's the nature of the domestic politics, which are opaque and essentially unresponsive to outside pressures,\" he said. Caster said the new arrest, coming soon after the disappearance of famous actress Fan Bingbing, who vanished for weeks after questions emerged around possible tax evasion, shows no one is safe from the Communist Party's reach. \"That China feels so emboldened to disappear even one of its most famous actresses ... should be a real wake up call that anyone within China could be next,\" Caster wrote from CNN in September. Serving at Xi's discretion As Xi's hold on power in China continues to tighten, complete obedience to the party and its leadership is being given even greater importance by Beijing than ever before. Across the country, officials at all levels of government are encouraged to read and learn from Xi's words, while the president even had a political theory added to China's constitution.

But despite the disquiet which China's actions in arrest may have caused globally, there is little likelihood of long term consequences for Beijing's actions. \"In the long term, other countries just have to live with China's political system ...

Media and entertainment industry shaken by allegations - CNN", "text": "New Delhi (CNN) A year after the fall of US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, a flurry of allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior has shaken the Indian media and entertainment industries, prompting many to ask if the #MeToo movement has finally arrived in the world's largest democracy.\nIn one high profile case, a Bollywood production house has been dissolved following sexual harassment allegations against one of its co-founders. A leading comedy outfit popular with Indian millennials was also shaken when a comedian it worked with faced harassment allegations, while in the media industry, allegations of inappropriate behavior saw a prominent Delhi-based political journalist lose his position pending an internal investigation, according to reports. Allegations have also been leveled against a minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Indian Bollywood actor Nana Patekar is mobbed by the media as he leaves after making a statement outside his home in Mumbai on October 8, 2018. The movement appears to have been prompted by allegations late last month by former Bollywood actress Tanushree Dutta, who spoke publicly about being a victim of assault allegedly at the hands of a former co-star in 2008. Read More \"He was grabbing me by the arms, pushing me around, then he would ask the choreographers to move and teach me how to dance and the next thing I know he wanted to do an intimate sequence with me. It was ridiculous,\" Dutta told CNN affiliate News18 about her experience when she worked with veteran actor Nana Patekar. Speaking to reporters at a hastily arranged news conference on Monday in Mumbai, Patekar dismissed questions, saying, \"My lawyers have told me not to speak to the media so I can't say anything. Otherwise, I would have said something in the past four days. This case is ten years old, what was true then is true today.\" CNN has reached out to Patekar's legal team but has yet to receive a response. Dutta's allegations prompted support from numerous leading industry figures, including \"Quantico\" star Priyanka Chopra, who tweeted agreeing with another actor that \"the world needs to #BelieveSurvivors.\" Agreed..the world needs to #BelieveSurviviors https://t.co/ia82UsCkkq\n\u2014 PRIYANKA (@priyankachopra) September 28, 2018 In the days since, numerous women from all walks of life have taken to social media to narrate their experiences of assault or inappropriate behavior at the hands of prominent Indian men. \"The stories are there so people can be safe,\" said Sheena Dabholkar , a writer and journalist who has been curating a feed of incidents on Twitter and naming those involved through messages that women have sent her directly. \"People worldwide have issues with boundaries and consent. Even recognizing discomfort in people and unwelcome behavior. I want to create an understanding of what people find acceptable and to create a conversation,\" Dabholkar told CNN. Bollywood filmmaker Anurag Kashyap seen at his office in Oshiwara on May 22, 2016 in Mumbai, India. Time's up for Bollywood? Many of the allegations have resulted in immediate consequences. On Saturday, news broke that Phantom Films, the Bollywood studio responsible for Netflix's first original series from India, was to fold. The announcement, made on Twitter by one of the studio's co-founders and prominent Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap, came after HuffPost India published a story in which a former female employee accused Vikas Bahl, another co-founder and director, of harassment. \"Phantom was a dream, a glorious one and all dreams come to an end. We did our best and we succeeded and we failed. But I know for sure we will come out of this stronger, wiser and will continue to pursue our dreams our own individual ways. We wish each other the best,\" Kashyap wrote on Twitter on October 6. Phantom was a dream, a glorious one and all dreams come to an end . We did our best and we succeeded and we failed. But i know for sure we will come out of this stronger, wiser and will continue to pursue our dreams our own individual ways. We wish each other the best.\n\u2014 Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) October 5, 2018 In the HuffPost piece , the former female employee accused Bahl of masturbating on her without consent after pretending to pass out on her bed. The alleged incident took place in May 2015. In October that year, she said she shared her experience with Kashyap but nothing was done and she resigned. Kashyap later issued a detailed statement on Twitter, saying: \"While at Phantom, I did everything I could, within what I was told by my partner and his lawyers. For legal and financial decisions, I was fully dependent on my partner and his team. They took care of those things so I could focus on what I did better, creatives. His word and his team's word on any matter used to be the final word for us.\" My statement in light of the recent HuffPost article and breaking up of Phantom .

Now in hindsight and after taking stock of things myself, I can quite see how I was ill-advised,\" he added. On Tuesday, Bahl's lawyers hit back forcefully at Kashyap, sending him a legal notice denying the allegations, and hitting back at his statement on Twitter and his interview to Huffpost. Bahl's lawyers said the accusations were made \"as a result of professional jealousy and with the sole intent to defame our client, malign his image and destroy his career.\" They sent a similar letter to Vikramaditya Motwane, another of Phantom Films' co-founders, who had also weighed in on the allegations on Twitter . Both letters were shared with CNN by Bahl's legal counsel. Indian film director, producer and screenwriter Vikas Bahl seen at an event on October 27, 2015 in Gurgaon, India. Indian media under scrutiny Away from Bollywood, the country's political and media industries have also come under scrutiny, with female journalists sharing incidents of sexual harassment. The most prominent person to be named so far is MJ Akbar, a former journalist and currently a junior foreign minister in Modi's government. In an article written for Vogue India in 2017, journalist Priya Ramani described an experience of workplace harassment that happened while during a job interview in a Mumbai hotel room. Ramani did not name the individual in the original account. However, on Monday, taking to Twitter, she identified the man as Akbar. I began this piece with my MJ Akbar story. Never named him because he didn't \"do\" anything. Lots of women have worse stories about this predator\u2014maybe they'll share. #ulti https://t.co/5jVU5WHHo7\n\u2014 Priya Ramani (@priyaramani) October 8, 2018 \"Turns out you were as talented a predator as you were a writer. It was more date, less interview,\" Ramani said of the encounter in her piece, which she claims took place when \"I was 23, you were 43.\" \"Come sit here, you said at one point, gesturing to a tiny space near you. I'm fine, I replied with a strained smile. I escaped that night, you hired me, I worked for you for many months even though I swore I would never be in a room alone with you again,\" wrote Ramani in her 2017 piece. On Tuesday, the Indian newspaper, The Telegraph , ran a story on the allegations against Akbar, its founding editor, under the headline \"#MeToo finger at Union minister.\" India's Ministry of External Affairs has declined to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, on Monday, Prashant Jha, political editor of the leading Hindustan Times daily, stepped down from his post after accusations of sexual harassment surfaced on Twitter, CNN affiliate News18 reported . Avantika Mehta, a former co-worker, said Jha had pursued her even though she turned down his advances. I'm the ex-lawyer HT correspondent mentioned in @MasalaBai 's story. This thread includes photos of my conversation with prashant jha. you will notice I do everything and beyond to not piss him off while he says he wants to hit on me\n\u2014 Avantika Mehta (@bitingfriends) October 6, 2018 CNN reached out to both Jha and the Hindustan Times' legal counsel but has not yet received a response. Going public The ongoing public naming and shaming have revolved around incidents ranging from lewd behavior, suggestive text messages and, in some cases, clear instances of sexual abuse. On October 4, the writer and performer Mahima Kukreja accused comedian Utsav Chakraborty of sending her pictures of his genitals. Her revelation has led to a wave of other women reporting similar incidents. I want everyone to know @Wootsaw is a piece of shit. He sent me a dick pic, was creepy, then cried saying I'll ruin his career if I tell others. I told two of the most influential men in comedy in India. Nothing happened. Let me tell you what else he has done with others.\n\u2014 Mahima Kukreja \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf08\u270a\ud83c\udffd (@AGirlOfHerWords) October 4, 2018 \"It's a little too late now but I am sorry. I really am. The past 24 hours were a crucible,\" Chakraborty tweeted a day later. Citing previous mental health conditions that he claimed impacted his decisions, he said, \"I faced a very scary personal truth. I can't think of myself as a victim anymore. Please tell me what to do now. How to make things right? I don't want anyone to be hurt anymore.\" It's a little too late now but I am sorry. I really am. The past 24 hours were a crucible.

Since yesterday we've been trying to introspect and process what we did wrong, and everything that came up during our conversations all feel like excuses in hindsight and fact of the matter is that we messed up,\" AIB said. The weeks ahead will indicate whether India's Me Too movement can maintain its momentum and what kind of action will be taken, especially against those in significant positions of power. Dabholkar is hopeful, saying, \"This is probably the biggest people-led one. India will have many Me Too movements.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.news18.com/news/movies/nana-patekar-denies-tanushree-dutta-allegations-considers-taking-legal-action-1891397.html", "https://www.vogue.in/content/harvey-weinsteins-open-letter-sexual-harassment/amp/", "https://twitter.com/anuragkashyap72/status/1048301339971936256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/weeny?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "https://twitter.com/AllIndiaBakchod/status/1048136877448937472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/priyaramani/status/1049279608263245824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Wootsaw/status/1048088816030953472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Wootsaw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/5jVU5WHHo7", "https://twitter.com/bitingfriends/status/1048570568734167041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/anuragkashyap72/status/1048860377910579205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ulti?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/ia82UsCkkq", "https://twitter.com/MasalaBai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/10/06/queen-director-vikas-bahl-sexually-assaulted-me-phantom-films-did-nothing-survivor-speaks-out_a_23552623/", "https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/indias-metoo-what-are-the-legal-options-for-the-survivors-now-1902897.html", "https://t.co/WCAsaj6uFR", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/anuragkashyap72/status/1048301339971936256", "https://twitter.com/VikramMotwane", "https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/metoo-finger-at-union-minister/cid/1671370#.W7wX1ca0OfE.twitter", "https://twitter.com/priyankachopra/status/1045528195745947648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/AGirlOfHerWords/status/1047774459824885760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BelieveSurviviors?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/Lpa9HKyORb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana patekar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T14:09:42.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0e87094c06f4871cc8dffe7130f6fbbf1111ae5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQHaFVPU55tX7cxq12Re2Yx45Imsck531fWhAUzc7DbLU", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi: Missing Saudi journalist's fiancee asks Trump for help in op-ed - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Jamal Khashoggi: Missing Saudi journalist's fiancee asks Trump for help in op-ed - CNNPolitics", "published": "2018-10-10T17:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.31, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181009110705-jamal-khashoggi-cctv-saudi-consulate-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 767, "comments": 442, "shares": 138}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0e87094c06f4871cc8dffe7130f6fbbf1111ae5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQHaFVPU55tX7cxq12Re2Yx45Imsck531fWhAUzc7DbLU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Sullivan", "published": "2018-10-10T17:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi: Missing Saudi journalist's fiancee asks Trump for help in op-ed - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) Missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e implored President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump \"to help shed light on\" his disappearance in an op-ed published by The Washington Post Tuesday .\nKhashoggi vanished on October 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul . As a columnist for the Post, he was a frequent critic of the regime in Riyadh. On Saturday, Turkish officials told the Post and Reuters that Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi consulate. CNN has not been able to independently confirm these reports, and the Saudi government has denied them. Khashoggi entered the consulate to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, who wrote in the op-ed: \"I implore President Trump and first lady Melania Trump to help shed light on Jamal's disappearance.\" \"Jamal is a valuable person, an exemplary thinker and a courageous man who has been fighting for his principles. I don't know how I can keep living if he was abducted or killed in Turkey,\" Cengiz wrote.

A Saudi official said Khashoggi left the consulate soon after but Riyadh has not released any surveillance footage or other evidence to prove that he did. Turkish staff who work at the consulate were told to take the day off the day Khashoggi disappeared, the Guardian reported. The Guardian also reported that Turkish investigators believe security footage from inside the consulate was removed and taken back to Saudi Arabia on a private jet. Cengiz wrote that Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in late September \"despite being somewhat concerned that he could be in danger.\" He returned for paperwork on October 2. After three hours of waiting outside, Cengiz was told that Khashoggi had already left but she says \"there's no proof that he came out.\" There was no warrant for Khashoggi's arrest in Saudi Arabia, she wrote, and he didn't think that the tensions between himself and the Saudi royal family were at a dangerous level. \"In other words, he did not mind walking into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul because he did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,\" Cengiz wrote. \"It would be a violation of international law to harm, arrest or detain people at a diplomatic mission, he said, and noted that no such thing had ever happened in Turkey's history.\" CCTV image of the missing Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has urged Saudi Arabia to prove that Khashoggi had left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. \"He entered the general consulate himself, and if he has entered by himself and if he did not exit it, of course this should be proven by the general consulate,\" Erdogan said at a news conference in Budapest Monday. Erdogan said the Saudi consulate should have surveillance cameras and should be able to show the video of Khashoggi leaving the building. He mentioned that there are no documents or other evidence that show the journalist departing. Cengiz urged Saudi Arabia, \"especially King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to ... release CCTV footage from the consulate.\" Saudi denials Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said claims that Khashoggi had been killed or detained by Saudi authorities were \"absolutely false, and baseless,\" according to a statement obtained by CNN. \"There are many facts regarding his whereabouts that will hopefully be revealed through the ongoing investigation. Despite that, we have seen over the last few days various malicious leaks and grim rumors flying around about Jamal's whereabouts and fate,\" the statement said. \"I assure you that the reports that suggest that Jamal Khashoggi went missing in the Consulate in Istanbul or that the Kingdom's authorities have detained him or killed him are absolutely false, and baseless,\" it noted. On Saturday, the consulate gave a tour of the six-story building to journalists in an effort to prove Khashoggi was not inside. Reuters said that a consulate official gave their journalists a tour of each room, even opening up cupboards and filing cabinets. The Turkish Foreign Ministry says Saudi officials have agreed to a search of the Istanbul consulate but the timing of the inspection is unclear. Looking for clues Turkish investigators are trying to piece together Khashoggi's movements before and after he entered the consulate. Erdogan said police are looking into the arrival of Saudi nationals to Turkey as part of their investigation into the disappearance. The 15 Saudis, including several officials, arrived in Istanbul on two planes and visited the consulate while Khashoggi was inside, a Turkish police statement said according to state news agency Anadolu. It has emerged that two executive jets belonging to a Riyadh-based company that does government contracting and corporate work were likely involved in ferrying 15 Saudis to Istanbul last week, according to a source familiar with the timing and route of the flights. Flight tracking data also backs up evidence of the planes' arrival in Istanbul. Aviation data obtained by CNN showed one of the flights left Riyadh Monday, October 1 at 11:30 p.m. local time (4:30 p.m. ET) and landed in Istanbul's Ataturk Airport just after 3:00 a.m. local time (8:00 p.m. ET). The data reveals the flight made no stopovers on its way to Istanbul. The jet left Ataturk airport late in the evening on Tuesday, October 2 at 11:00 p..m. local (4:00 p.m. ET) and arrived in Riyadh the following day. The second flight departed Riyadh on Tuesday morning, the same day Khashoggi visited the Saudi consulate. Data shows this flight arrived at 5:00 p.m. local (10:00 a.m. ET) and only spent one hour on the ground. It then made a stopover in Cairo, before returning to Riyadh. CNN has not been able to independently confirm that the two planes carried the 15 passengers and has not seen the flight manifest. International demands for answers International pressure is mounting on Riyadh to explain Khashoggi's disappearance. Trump spoke about it briefly with reporters on Monday. \"There's some pretty bad stories about it,\" Trump added. \"I do not like it.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed his comments in a statement late Wednesday, saying there were \"conflicting reports,\" but that the US was \"concerned\" by Khashoggi's disappearance. \"We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to support a thorough investigation of Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance and to be transparent about the results of that investigation,\" Pompeo said. The UK and France have also voiced concern over the disappearance, with British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meeting with the Saudi Arabian ambassador to London to seek \"urgent answers\" on Khashoggi. But fears are mounting that he may no longer be alive. A political adviser to Erdogan, Yasin Aktay, told CNN on Sunday he personally believes the possibility that Khashoggi was likely killed in the Saudi consulate is \"stronger than other possibilities,\" because otherwise Saudi authorities would have provided evidence that the is alive. A friend of Khashoggi, Turan Kislakci, who is also the head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association, told CNN that Turkish officials had called him and \"offered their condolences and told us to be ready for a funeral.\" In the Washington Post, Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e Cengiz wrote that she's holding onto hope that he's safe. \"Although my hope slowly fades away each passing day,\" she added. \"I remain confident that Jamal is still alive.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/09/please-president-trump-shed-light-on-my-fiances-disappearance/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.41e333c6fa01"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jamal khashoggi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jamal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatice cengiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cengiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khashoggi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T14:07:27.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b0c6e4de67e7981d46c659909d0530709b16d5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQNLLbhMv3CauHjnfsgrmkR1ulP2buzokjwQMbU.ODGsp", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Australian law allows religious schools to reject gay students, PM says - CNN", "title_full": "Australian law allows religious schools to reject gay students, PM says - CNN", "published": "2018-10-10T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180109104943-10-australia-same-sex-weddings-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1603, "comments": 698, "shares": 166}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b0c6e4de67e7981d46c659909d0530709b16d5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJedTas2sAQcQNLLbhMv3CauHjnfsgrmkR1ulP2buzokjwQMbU.ODGsp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joshua Berlinger", "published": "2018-10-10T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Australian law allows religious schools to reject gay students, PM says - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Prime Minister Scott Morrison said religious schools in Australia are already legally allowed to deny students a place based on their sexual orientation, following criticism of a leaked report that proposes allowing schools to bar them.\nMorrison was commenting on the contents of a leaked report on religious freedoms, reigniting debate about what constitutes unlawful discrimination against gay people just months after Australia's Parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage. Fairfax Media reported Wednesday it had seen contents of the report , which recommended amendments to a federal law that allows religious schools to discriminate against students \"on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status.\" When asked if he thought religious schools should be able to turn away students on the basis of sexual orientation, Morrison demurred twice, saying \"that is the existing law.\" The Prime Minister's office said he was referring to a section in the federal Sex Discrimination Act that exempts religious educational institutions from some discrimination requirements. However, some states have passed their own discrimination laws and do not allow religious schools to reject students on the basis of sexual orientation.

But Morrison said any new laws would take into account the religious freedom review, which Turnbull commissioned in order to assuage the concerns of marriage equality opponents who said the new law infringed on their religious rights. The report was compiled after a public consultation period that attracted 15,000 submissions and submitted to Turnbull in May, but the government has yet to formally release it, Fairfax reported. \"We have a report that's been provided to the government. It's a report to government, not from government. It's a report that the government will be considering and developing a balanced response to, and we will do that in our orderly process, taking it through Cabinet,\" Morrison said Wednesday. Critics, including civil liberty groups, members of the opposition Labor Party and gay rights advocates, said the government should not be proposing avenues for discrimination. \"The fact of the matter is that every child is entitled to human dignity. We shouldn't even be having this debate,\" opposition leader Bill Shorten said. Alex Greenwich, an MP from Sydney and a gay rights activist, said he was concerned about the divisiveness of the report. \"One of the tragic things out of this report is it seeks to establish a narrative of gay versus God,\" he told Sky News Australia. \"The faith community is largely supportive of the LGBTQI community and the LGBTQI community is very supportive and respective of the faith community.\" Australia's new PM is Scott Morrison, a pentecostal political chameleon According to Fairfax, the panel rejected the idea put forward by Australian conservatives that religious freedom was in \"imminent peril.\" It also found that businesses should not be allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds because it would \"unnecessarily encroach on other human rights\" and \"may cause significant harm to vulnerable groups,\" Fairfax reported. Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter said in a statement Wednesday that the report does not propose creating any new exemptions for religious schools to discriminate on the basis of sexuality, nor does it make any changes to the regime currently in place. The law was last amended in 2012, when the opposition Labor party was in power. \"The exemption that allows schools to make employment and student admission decisions in a way consistent with the tenets of their religion already exists for religious schools,\" he said. Morrison said the report has not been considered by the Cabinet, but would be released \"in due course.\" \"It will be released with a response from the Government, once we're in a position to advise our comprehensive response to that report, and once we've carefully considered and respectfully considered all the measures and recommendations and proposals that have been put forward,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-vows-to-change-laws-on-religious-freedom-but-won-t-be-a-culture-warrior-pm-20180907-p502da.html", "https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/", "https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00383", "https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/religious-freedom-review-enshrines-right-of-schools-to-turn-away-gay-children-and-teachers-20181009-p508o7.html", "https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=world/2017/11/15/australia-yes-to-same-sex-marriage-equality-nielsen-intv.cnn&customer=cnn&edition=international&env=prod"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott morrison", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "morrison", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T14:10:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9813f753f03d7e1d0c44327c5a1cfb04ba107ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJc9RFyQsNuztcK76Z7gg1aRHnnFvbTPgIzJjcNYpKNXdy.apPxJmjNM", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_meast.rss", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jamal Trump 'concerned' about missing journalist as Saudis deny involvement - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Jamal Khashoggi: Trump 'concerned' about missing journalist as Saudis deny involvement - CNNPolitics", "published": "2018-10-09T19:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181009110705-jamal-khashoggi-cctv-saudi-consulate-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 159, "comments": 221, "shares": 132}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9813f753f03d7e1d0c44327c5a1cfb04ba107ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiuH.mYBn3VJc9RFyQsNuztcK76Z7gg1aRHnnFvbTPgIzJjcNYpKNXdy.apPxJmjNM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zachary Cohen", "published": "2018-10-09T19:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jamal Trump 'concerned' about missing journalist as Saudis deny involvement - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Monday that he was \"concerned\" about reports on the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post writer and Saudi royal court insider-turned-critic.\n\"I am concerned about that,\" Trump said. \"I don't like hearing about it and hopefully that will sort itself out.

The new process will be slower, more deliberate and hopefully secure. Best Silica Gel Multicolor Mini Book light Reading Lamp USB LED Light Computer Lamp for Notebook PC Laptop Reading Night\nThe changes are part of \u201cProject Strobe,\u201d a \u201croot-and-branch review of third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data and our philosophy around apps\u2019 data access.\u201d Essentially they decided it was time to update the complex and likely not entirely cohesive set of rules and practices around those third-party developers and API access.\nOne of those roots (or perhaps branches) was the bug discovered inside Google+, which theoretically (the company can\u2019t tell if it was abused or not) exposed non-public profile data to apps that should have received only a user\u2019s public profile. This, combined with the fact that Google+ never really justified its own existence in the first place, led to the service essentially being shut down. \u201cThe consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement,\u201d Google admitted. \u201c90 percent of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds.\u201d\nBut the team doing the review has plenty of other suggestions to improve the process of informed consent to sharing data with third parties.\nThe first change is the most user-facing. When an application wants to access your Google account data \u2014 say your Gmail, Calendar and Drive contents for a third-party productivity app \u2014 you\u2019ll have to approve each one of those separately. You\u2019ll also have the opportunity to deny access to one or more of those requests, so if you never plan on using the Drive functionality, you can just nix it and the app will never get that permission.\nThese permissions can also be delayed and gated behind the actions that require them. For instance, if this theoretical app wanted to give you the opportunity to take a picture to add to an email, it wouldn\u2019t have to ask up front when you download it. Instead, when you tap the option to attach a picture, it would ask permission to access the camera then and there. Google went into a little more detail on this in a post on its developer blog.\nNotably there is only the option to \u201cdeny\u201d or \u201callow,\u201d but no \u201cdeny this time\u201d or \u201callow this time,\u201d which I find to be useful when you\u2019re not totally on board with the permission in question. You can always revert the setting manually, but it\u2019s nice to have the option to say \u201cokay, just this once, strange app.\u201d Best Silica Gel Multicolor Mini Book light Reading Lamp USB LED Light Computer Lamp for Notebook PC Laptop Reading Night\nThe changes will start rolling out this month, so don\u2019t be surprised if things look a little different next time you download a game or update an app.\nThe second and third changes have to do with limiting which data from your Gmail and messaging can be accessed by apps, and which apps can be granted access in the first place.\nSpecifically, Google is restricting access to these sensitive data troves to apps \u201cdirectly enhancing email functionality\u201d for Gmail and your default calling and messaging apps for call logs and SMS data.\nThere are some edge cases where this might be annoying to power users; some have more than one messaging app that falls back to SMS or integrates SMS replies, and this might require those apps to take a new approach. And apps that want access to these things may have trouble convincing Google\u2019s review authorities that they qualify.\nDevelopers also will need to review and agree to a new set of rules governing what Gmail data can be used, how they can use it and the measures they must have in place to protect it. For example, apps are not allowed to \u201ctransfer or sell the data for other purposes such as targeting ads, market research, email campaign tracking, and other unrelated purposes.\u201d That probably puts a few business models out of the running.\nApps looking to handle Gmail data will also have to submit a report detailing \u201capplication penetration testing, external network penetration testing, account deletion verification, reviews of incident response plans, vulnerability disclosure programs, and information security policies.\u201d No fly-by-night operations permitted, clearly.\nThere also will be additional scrutiny on what permissions developers ask for to make sure it matches up with what their app requires. If you ask for Contacts access but don\u2019t actually use it for anything, you\u2019ll be asked to remove that, as it only increases risk.\nThese various new requirements will go into effect next year, with application review (a multi-week process) starting on January 9; tardy developers will see their apps stop working at the end of March if they don\u2019t comply.\nThe relatively short timeline here suggests that some apps may in fact shut down temporarily or permanently due to the rigors of the review process.

The patient was identified on the recording as an abortion patient.\nMedical staff had unsuccessfully attempted to stop the bleeding using a Foley catheter, which is a tube with a balloon that can be inflated to apply pressure to staunch the bleeding of internal injuries.\nThe Planned Parenthood caller told the 911 dispatcher that the woman was still in in a procedure room on the lower level of the building.\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\nThe second incident happened just three weeks later on July 27 when a Planned Parenthood worker again dialed 911 to ask for an ambulance for another abortion patient.\nA 30-year old woman suffered uncontrolled vaginal bleeding after an abortion. The 911 dispatcher instructed Planned Parenthood to keep someone in the room with her until help could arrive.\nThe dispatcher acted familiar with the Planned Parenthood abortion business and asked specific questions about whether the patient had an abortion.\nThe dispatcher also asked if protesters were present, as well, but no pro-life presence was said to have been there at that time.\n\u201cWe fully expect to see more women injured by abortion at this Chicago Planned Parenthood before the end of the year,\u201d said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. \u201cIt is a sad reality of abortion that babies die and their mothers are maimed and sometimes killed at shoddy facilities like this one.

BusinessTelegraph", "text": "Type 2 diabetes: Three meals to avoid to prevent blood sugar spikes October 9, 2018 Print\nType 2 diabetes is a common condition in the UK often caused by a person being overweight or obese through poor diet choices.\nMany people with type 2 diabetes don\u2019t realise they have it because symptoms don\u2019t necessarily make you feel unwell. But if it\u2019s left untreated, it can lead to serious complications.\nOne way to prevent and control the condition is to make some simple diet changes.\nThere are three meals in particularly which should be avoided when it comes to breakfast, dinner and dessert. Breakfast\nBupa says eating carbohydrates can make your blood sugar shoot up, so counting and using a glycemic index can be useful.\nMatthew Freeby, MD, director of the Gonda Diabetes Center at UCLA Health, says one particular food that falls into the carbohydrate category should be avoided all together.\nSpeaking to Prevention, Mr Freeby said popular breakfast item, the bagel, should be crossed off the menu.\nHe explained: \u201cMany of my patients with diabetes think about sugar as being the worst thing that\u2019s impacting their blood sugar, but it\u2019s really about carbohydrates.\n\u201cI tell them to look at nutrition labels for the total carbohydrate content, not just the sugar content.\n\u201cDonuts and bagels made with refined and processed grains are major sources of blood-sugar-spiking carbs.\u201d Dinner\nStarchy foods, such as potatoes, meat, fish, eggs, pulses, beans and nuts are recommended for people with type 2 diabetes.\nBut people with diabetes should try to minimise their intake of industrial trans fats as they can have a negative impact on blood sugar levels, according to nutritionists at Healthline.\nTrans fats are created by adding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty acids in order to make them more stables, and the site says you should avoid frozen dinners that contain them.\nIt adds: \u201cAlthough trans fats don\u2019t directly raise blood sugar levels, they\u2019ve been linked to increased inflammation, insulin resistance and belly fat, as well as lower \u2018good\u2019 HDL cholesterol levels and impaired arterial function.\n\u201cThese effects are especially concerning for people with diabetes, as they are at an increased risk of heart disease.\u201d Dessert\nDiabetes UK says foods labelled as \u2018diabetic\u2019 offer no benefit to people with diabetes and may still affect blood glucose levels.\nDiabetic puddings, cakes and chocolate are popular \u2018diabetic\u2019 food items.\nThe research charity adds: \u201cIt adds: \u201cThey are expensive and contain as much fat and calories as ordinary versions, and they can also have a laxative effect.\u201d\nHow can you identify type 2 diabetes in the first place?

The startup is also officially expanding into Miami, Cincinnati and Denver. Based in Austin, The Guild has a handful of properties in Austin and Dallas.\nThe Guild works by partnering with building owners to operate hotel accommodations in commercially-zoned or mixed-use buildings. The Guild\u2019s room offerings range from a mix of traditional hotel rooms to more apartment-style accommodations (think studio, 1 BR and 2 BR apartments).\nRight now, The Guild leases the 290 units across its five markets, but the company is open to revenue-share and other types of financing structures down the road. Before launching in a market, The Guild looks at the area\u2019s walkability and the prevalence of businesses and conferences. In general, it\u2019s paying attention to the potential for marketability. By the end of next year, The Guild expects to operate in 1,000 units across up to 10 markets.\nThe Guild aims to differentiate itself from traditional hotels with its technology. Guests, for example, can quickly get food delivered from services like UberEats and DoorDash, rather than pay highway robbery for room service.\nThe Guild also offers digital check-in and keyless entry. But the idea isn\u2019t to replace humans with technology. While The Guild uses technology as a means of communication, there is still a front desk person on hand to help around the clock.\n\u201cWe use tech as a way to connect people,\u201d The Guild co-founder Brian Carrico told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve found people like human interaction and connection. Humans are fed a lot of information about why guests are there and then use that information to surprise and delight guests.\u201d\nOn average, The Guild exchanges 40 text messages with every guest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see how tech can connect people and not be a substitute for people,\u201d Carrico said.\nThe Guild functions as both the brand and the operator, which Carrico says makes it possible to run a viable business while ensuring workers are taken care of. For example, every single employee \u2014 which covers the front desk, reservations and maintenance, gets health insurance and equity in the company. While The Guild does not employ housekeeping workers, Carrico says the vendor it works with pays above market rate.

According to the investigative site, \"multiple sources familiar with Mishkin, both in St. Petersburg and in his native Loyga\" identified Petrov as Mishkin. CNN has not independently verified Bellingcat's reporting. The UK's Metropolitan Police Service said it would not comment on speculation regarding the true identities of the two men accused of poisoning Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the nerve agent Novichok in the southern English city of Salisbury in March. In a statement, the Met reiterated it believed the two suspects \"were using aliases and a European Arrest Warrant and Interpol Red Notices remain in circulation for the two men.\" Read More Bellingcat last month named the other suspect in the Skripal poisonings as GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, also known as Ruslan Boshirov. Its first article naming him went into great detail about how it had come up with the name, including speaking to \"multiple sources familiar with the person and/or the investigation.\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the first report \"bogus.\" CNN has contacted her and Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the new article. Salisbury attack suspects Alexander Petrov, left, and Ruslan Boshirov. Both have been claimed to be undercover agents of Russian military intelligence. Secret identity Bellingcat said Mishkin was born in 1979 in the village of Loyga, and graduated from one of Russia's elite Military Medical Academies, where he was trained as a military doctor for the Russian naval armed forces. \"During his medical studies, Mishkin was recruited by the GRU, and by 2010 had relocated to Moscow, where he received his undercover identity -- including a second national ID and travel passport -- under the alias Alexander Petrov,\" the website said. It added that Mishkin \"traveled extensively under his new identity,\" including to the Ukraine and the self-declared Transnistrian Republic in Moldova, which is supported by Moscow. While it said his current military rank is unknown, the Bellingcat report said it could be \"posited that as the time of the Skripals' poisoning incident he was either a Lt. Colonel or a full Colonel.\" JUST WATCHED Official mocks blunders by Russian agents Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nOfficial mocks blunders by Russian agents 02:37 Bob Seely, a Conservative member of the foreign affairs committee of the UK's House of Commons, expressed dismay at the suggestion of a doctor's involvement. \"It's appalling that a medical doctor appears to have been part of a team of GRU operatives that attempted to deliver a lethal poison to their target -- and accidentally killed another person by mistake,\" he told CNN. \"Whilst this operation has been a botched embarrassment for the Kremlin from beginning to end, it's worth remembering that we may not know about the GRU's successful operations and therefore shouldn't judge the GRU alone by their failures.\" Seely told CNN this latest report shows the UK needs to step up its \"long-term plan to understand and exposed Russian subversion.\" Putin dismisses controversy The alleged poisonings of the Skripals by Russian agents caused significant fallout between Moscow and London , with many allies of the UK also weighing in against the Kremlin. At an energy forum in Moscow last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the furor, calling Skripal a \"traitor\" and a \"scumbag\" and suggesting the incident was being \"artificially blown up\" by the media. \"I see that some of your colleagues are pushing the theory that Mr. Skripal is almost a human-rights activist,\" Putin said in response to a journalist's question about the case. \"He's just a spy. A traitor to the Motherland. There's such a thing as a traitor to the Motherland. He's one of them. He's just a scumbag, that's all.\" Putin said that the Salisbury affair \"is being artificially ... blown up\" by the media, but added: \"It'll pass, eventually ...

Check secondhand furniture, beds, and couches for any signs of bed bug infestation before bringing them home.\u201d\nIt\u2019s best to make sure a bed bug infestation doesn\u2019t happen in the first place, as they can be quite resilient.\nBed bugs can live without feeding for several months, so getting rid of them can be difficult, it said. READ Gene editing wipes out mosquitoes in the lab\nThere\u2019s no quick fix to getting rid of bed bugs, but you could use heat treatment to try and treat the infestation.\nTry using a clothes dryer on a high heat after washing your clothes. If you don\u2019t have a dryer, pop them all in a black bin bag and place them outside in the sun.\nSteam cleaners can get into the cracks of the bedding, carpets and bed frames.\nCarefully check for bed bugs every few days after the initial clear out.\nYou could have a bed bug infestation if you find small, tiny white eggs in the crevices of your furniture.\nThe bites themselves are another key warning sign. Look out for small red bumps on the skin.\nThe bumps, which can be itchy, are usually found on the face, neck, hands or arms.\nThe bites usually fade after a few days, but antihistamine tablets could help to relieve itchiness if you\u2019re struggling.\nSpeak to a GP if you develop signs of a skin infection.

That description could actually go for both of them, depending upon who you ask. Remember the simpler times, when being #TeamTay or #TeamYe was more about taste in music? Well, welcome to a politically divided America where anything can happen. Read More Both Swift and West have had equally devoted fan bases, many of whom took sides back in 2009 when West infamously hijacked the microphone from Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards. Their ensuing bad blood spilled over in 2016, after a dispute over whether or not West cleared song lyrics about Swift with the singer. Kanye West peeves Taylor Swift's fans -- again Fast forward to today. West has become a major supporter of President Donald Trump, often donning a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and speaking out for his \"brother,\" who West says shares his \"dragon energy.\" \"There's so many times I talk to, like, a white person about this and they say, 'How could you like Trump? He's racist,'\" West said during a recent appearance on \"Saturday Night Live.\" \"If I was concerned about racism, I would've moved out of America a long time ago.\" Kanye West goes on a Trump rant from 'SNL' stage as show ends His stance has stirred outrage among his followers, but earned West praise from some conservatives. The oppression of people like Kanye West for his support of President Trump shows exactly how horrible Hollywood is.\nPeople are starting to rise up and realizing the Democratic Party is oppressing them. FOUR MORE YEARS!\n\u2014 Ryan Fournier (@RyanAFournier) October 2, 2018 Meanwhile Swift, who has long stayed out of public political debate, endorsed two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee on Sunday. Taylor Swift no longer mum on politics after endorsing Democrats in Tennessee midterm races The singer alluded to her #MeToo experience as one of the reasons she felt led to throw her support behind the candidates, writing \"due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about [publicly voicing her political opinions] now.\"\nView this post on Instagram I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info.

Only with \"The Circus,\" an oddly timely PBS documentary, it's the \"greatest show on Earth\" that fell victim to a new delivery system -- namely, television.\nThe circus fell victim to programs like \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" which gradually brought such novelties directly into the home, cutting the legs out from under it. That's a rather sobering thought, given that traditional TV currently finds itself under siege, from streaming and other alternative programming options. That framing provides the bigger picture in an extremely entertaining four-hour documentary, which, like the best PBS fare, filters American history through the lens of a specific event or institution, a la \"The Civil War\" or \"Baseball.\" A sweeping look at life under the big top, \"The Circus\" also explores a variety of issues -- race, women's suffrage, animal rights, and shared pop culture -- through the larger-than-life hucksters and performers that birthed the self-anointed Greatest Show on Earth. Although it bears all the hallmarks of those aforementioned Ken Burns documentaries, \"The Circus\" was written and directed by Sharon Grimberg, under the \"American Experience\" banner. The two-night project -- chronicling the circus from its late-18th-century founding through the end of its heyday in the 1950s -- auspiciously follows last year's surprise hit \"The Greatest Showman,\" the movie loosely inspired by the life of P.T. Barnum, who is not surprisingly a central figure here. Read More Perhaps most notably, the circus was one of the few shared cultural experiences that connected the nation in the days before radio and TV. Indeed, people frequently gained their first glimpse of exotic animals, like elephants, when the circus came to town. Owners like Barnum and the Ringling brothers, meanwhile, ushered in an age of corporate entertainment, turning local and regional pastimes into \"an industrial experience.\" \"As the country grew, the circus evolved with it,\" the narration notes. \"The Circus\" also spends a good deal of time chronicling the impact of technology, from a practical perspective -- as the railroad allowed the traveling show to bypass small towns and head to big cities -- and in terms of innovation, with electric lighting and moving pictures among the draws the impresarios used to attract crowds. Perhaps the most sobering thread deals with an escalating arms race involving circus animals, especially elephants, including the ruthless means used to procure them and the conditions under which they were forced to live. (Elephants remained part of the Ringling Bros. show until they were finally retired in 2016.) Grimberg takes a few detours along the way, dealing with famed acts as well as the competitive machinations involving circus owners, who were among the highest-profile tycoons of their time. The documentary also captures the romance that surrounded these shows -- and how the liberating image of \"running away to join the circus\" still lingers. Nor should it be lost that the current cultural and political comparisons prompts frequent comparisons to a \"circus\" atmosphere and the means that Barnum and his competitors employed to dazzle the \"rubes.\" Today, no one needs to run away -- or even leave the house -- to catch \"The Circus.\" And while PBS is too demure to promote it as \"the greatest show on TV,\" it's certainly a good one -- reminding us that even the most venerable entertainment spectacles are vulnerable to changing times. \"The Circus\" will air Oct. 8-9 at 9 p.m. on PBS.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/circus/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-09T01:08:35.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08781a729ca9b67cf48381308e2b8f8b2a42d24a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2TeHpHFEtEgLcmAvMUWLRqqMjGF66eipHWQr8x4iEXSpb.Sckp5RITag--", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/forums", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "Forums - Google News", "title": "League of Women Voters to host candidate forums - KAUZ", "title_full": "League of Women Voters to host candidate forums - KAUZ", "published": "2018-10-11T01:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.newschannel6now.com/resizer/Uz1u2ZfAbF2aC4_UfaOtqppScUc=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-raycom.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JBF5V5O4KVAQPBO22V62EMW6MU.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08781a729ca9b67cf48381308e2b8f8b2a42d24a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2TeHpHFEtEgLcmAvMUWLRqqMjGF66eipHWQr8x4iEXSpb.Sckp5RITag--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-11T01:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "League of Women Voters to host candidate forums - KAUZ", "text": "League of Women Voters to host candidate forums League of Women Voters to host candidate forums By Nicholas Davis | October 10, 2018 at 5:03 PM CDT - Updated October 10 at 6:08 PM\nWICHITA FALLS, TX (RNN Texoma) - The League of Women Voters of Wichita Falls will host a Candidate\u2019s Forum on October 15 and October 16, at 7:00 p.m. in the Wichita Falls City Council Chambers.\nThe League of Women Voters is nonpartisan and neither supports or opposes candidates or political parties.\nContested City races include Mayor, Councilor District 4 and Councilor District 5.\nWichita Falls ISD contested races include District 3 and At-Large 4-year term.\nOther contested races include County Commissioner Precinct 4, Senate District 30 and U.S. Congressional District 13.\nMonday night will be for Mayor, City Council, and County Commissioner Candidates.\nTuesday night will be for School Board, Senate District 30, and for Congressional District 13.\nCopyright 2018 RNN Texoma.

This has been demonstrated by three recent events: the latest Stuart Robert rorting scandal, the Sydney Opera House projection debacle, and the Government's out-of-hand rejection of the latest - most alarming - IPCC report.\nBut before we consider those events, let's look at why the people who run the world think everyone is else is also avaricious, just like themselves.\nTHE JUSTIFICATION FOR GREED\nThe people who run the world mostly call themselves conservatives, but are really radicals of the most rapacious kind. They have built up a vast armoury of dogma to justify their sociopathic level of greed.\nAs economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote:\n'The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.'\nNeoclassical economics and its ideological offshoot, neoliberalism, provide the bedrock of this dogma.\nIt provides, indeed, one of the fundamental assumptions of modern economics: \"rational self-interest\", or \"market theory\".

Bureaucrats manoeuvred to create more bureaucracy; academics, whatever they said in their scholarly papers, really sought further funding increases.\nAs a result, commercial decisions were necessarily more legitimate than government restrictions on commerce, since the latter merely cloaked sectional motivations behind self-serving bunkum about \"the public interest\".\nIt suggests that no sensible person ever puts aside their own personal interests out of kindness or compassion, or desire for the greater good, but always simply looks to maximise their own returns. It is, in short, the ideology of sociopathy.\nIf this is what conservatives truly believe - that everyone is just as greedy as they are - then the three recent scandals mentioned earlier are far easier to comprehend.\nTHE LATEST STUART ROBERT RORTING SCANDAL\nNewly appointed Assistant Treasurer Stuart Robert was last week caught rorting his parliamentary allowances. It emerged he had been recouping from the taxpayer over $2,000 a month for his home internet over several months. Robert claimed that it was all to do with charges for exceeding the data allowance on his provider's plan. Just how much and what he was downloading to incur these astronomical charges is not known. After being caught, Robert agreed to pay back all the excess charges.\nThis was not the first time Robert has been caught for rorting the taxpayer.

He was also one of those implicated in the infamous \"fake\" Rolexes affair, and he has been involved in numerous other notorious incidents of alleged financial and ethical breaches, including being investigated by the Queensland Corruption Commission.\nIt is a pattern of behaviour consistent with an overriding sense of entitlement and greed, yet he has never once apologised or admitted fault for anything. But he is a self-professed \"Christian\" who has self-published books on Jesus. How can all this be reconciled? Be morally justified?\nWell, under public choice theory, quite easily. Robert has been simply doing what a conservative would assume any other rational person would do in his position: maximising his returns.\nAs for his so-called Christianity, Robert is a Pentecostal Christian, which preaches \"prosperity theology\" - that God rewards the faithful with riches. It's a sort of Gordon Gecko, \"greed is good\" branch of Christianity. You know, just like Jesus preached.\nTHE SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE LIVID FESTIVAL\nThis week has seen outrage aplenty after the NSW State Government caved in to radio bully Alan Jones' demands, on behalf of racing interests, that they broadcast the barrier draw of a Sydney horse race onto the City's famous sails. The main purpose, it emerged, was to provide a colourful backdrop at a swanky party for NSW racing figures and NSW politicians.\nObjections were intense and centred around the decision being opposed to the public good. That it was out of character - and possibly illegal - for this World Heritage-listed national icon and centre for the arts to be used as a tacky promotion for gambling and commercial interests. A poll showed that more than 80% of NSW residents opposed the plan. Articles were written, social media was in full froth, a petition of more than a quarter-of-a-million signatures was collected opposing the move and more than 100,000 people turned out last night to chant and shine their torches on the Opera House sails to disrupt the display. The Chaser boys even did a prank.\nNevertheless, the display went ahead, with politicians from both sides of politics supporting the move, most citing the \"commercial\" benefits.

These effects include, amongst many others, crippling droughts, mass starvation, rampant disease, the loss of 98% of the world's reefs, and mass plant and animal extinction.\nThe IPCC report noted that the world - and Australia - was not on track to meet its 2030 Paris Agreement commitments.

Rather, to use co-founder Bill Mitchell's word, it is a \"lens\" that allows us to see more clearly what already exists.\nSo, its proponents claim it is not particularly ideological. The ideology comes afterwards when we craft policies based on an understanding of MMT.\nAt MMT's centre are claims about the currency-issuing capacity of governments like Australia - what the limits are and what the likely effects would be if the government adopted an expansionary or contractionary fiscal stance, mostly via spending and taxation.\nAlso at the centre of MMT is a government job guarantee.\nThe job guarantee sounds like a new policy proposal rather than an economic identity that already exists, but Mitchell says this is not quite correct.\n'So, while the Job Guarantee superficially appears to be a policy prescription, which would suggest that MMT is more than just a superior lens through which you can understand how the monetary system actually works and better appreciate the capacities of the currency-issuing government, the reality is that if one establishes that \"economy\" is about the elimination of inefficiencies, then the choice between the two price stabilising realities:\n(a) a NAIRU unemployment buffer stock system; and\n(b) a Job Guarantee employment buffer stock system is a non-choice.\nOnly (b) is closer to being efficient, given the massive wastage of income and human potential that arises.\nSo the Job Guarantee is much more than a simple \"policy prescription\". It is an essential component of a macroeconomic stability framework, a point that is lost on many, who only construct it as a job creation program.'\nNuances aside, what is the MMT job guarantee?\nIn essence, it means that the Federal Government would provide a real job at the minimum wage to any person of working age who wanted more hours of work (up to full-time hours).\nTherefore, the Australian workforce would consist of:\nThose working in the private sector, as they do now. Those working in the public sector (public servants), as they do now. Those working in the job guarantee scheme on the minimum wage.\nAt the moment, the unemployed and underemployed in Australia - almost 2 million people - form a \"buffer stock\" of potential workers that employers can draw from. (Overseas workers also increasingly form a buffer stock for Australian firms.)\nMitchell argues that employers quite like this arrangement - it not only disciplines inflation, but it also disciplines the unions and the workers themselves.\nTo put it more bluntly, power has shifted to the employers as secure work has become harder to get.\nUnder the MMT job guarantee, those who currently want work (or more work) would suddenly become a buffer stock of actual workers, earning a base income, being productive, learning new skills and enjoying newfound self-esteem.\nIf you lost your regular job or were leaving the education system without a job, you would be instantly employed in the government job guarantee scheme.\nInstead of the dole ($275 a week) which nobody should be expected to live on, you would receive the minimum wage, which is now about $720 for a 38-hour week.\nImportantly, people would not expect to stay in the job guarantee scheme forever. Rather, they would transition in and out of the job guarantee scheme as normal employers needed to hire or fire workers.\nIn short, the job guarantee scheme would be a safety net that should be much preferred to the current system of the dole, work-for-the-dole, work-seeking tests, and so on.\nNote that the job guarantee is not a variant of the work-for-the-dole scheme.\nNo doubt that is why GetUp has made the job guarantee a feature of its new economic policy, Future to Fight For.\nWhere will the money come from?\nAnswer: the same place that all Federal Government spending comes from - a bottomless pit of computer keyboard strokes.\nBut won't that mean the Federal Government will mostly have to run budget deficits?\nAnswer: yes, which is normal and will continue till doomsday, as also happens in the UK and USA.\nObviously, the Federal Government could easily spend too much relative to taxation, our balance of payments and the productive capacity of the economy (resulting in high inflation) but that has little to do with running sensible budget deficits.\nIn fact, the Federal Government cannot precisely determine the actual budget (fiscal) balance due to the powerful effect of the automatic stabilisers (the rise and fall of welfare payments and tax receipts as the economy waxes and wanes).\nSensible targets for a Federal Government are full employment, low inflation, low-interest rates, manageable private-sector debt and a high genuine progress indicator in keeping with the ecological capacity of the planet.\nWe can call that a qualitatively improving steady-state economy.\nWhat would the jobs be?\nA job-guarantee job would be productive work that needs to be done but is not in competition with the pre-existing public service or the private sector.\nThis could include some aspects of child care, care for the elderly at home, maintenance of public parks, maintenance of public housing, bushcare and other environmental work.\nJobs would be matched to people's skills and interests as far as possible.\nThe scheme would be administered at the local level and local authorities could be expected to know what they need done.\nIt follows that people would be more able to stay in regional areas if they so desired.\nHow many people would be on the scheme?\nAs already explained, people would transition in and out of the scheme in response to fluctuations in the economy and the resultant need to hire and fire in the normal way.\nHowever, under a less Neoliberal policy regime, with government resuming its former ownership and management of natural monopolies and \"public goods\" like energy generation and distribution, ports, airports, communications and even banking, one can envision a greatly expanded public service where \"downsizing\" is jettisoned along with unnecessary profit-seeking.\nSimilarly, a properly funded state and local government sector could employ many people, resulting in fewer people in the job guarantee scheme.\nExpanding all levels of government would heavily ameliorate the need for job-guarantee places.\nIf automation continues, then cuts to the number of hours that define the \"normal\" working week would do the same.\nHas a job guarantee scheme been tried anywhere else?\nYes. There has been a limited scheme running in India since 2005 and Argentina trialled a scheme from the early 2000s.\nWhat about a universal basic income instead?\nIn the GetUp policy already mentioned, a guaranteed basic income is combined with a job guarantee scheme. This policy recognises the role that meaningful work plays in people's lives, whereas simply providing money would not fulfil most people's needs.\nThe government job guarantee - an idea whose time has come.\nStephen Williams is a freelance journalist focusing on politics, economics and the environment.\nSupport independent journalism Subscribe to IA.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T06:34:55.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11938f8b69382cc1883a0b90911b8fd30d952f7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2Tug8Wsin2GM8E5QinzvRFUV8g3l9.LhM_XGFPYg5iivY-", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://www.africaengineeringnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "AFRICA ENGINEERING NEWS", "title": "Interview: eMedia Holdings CEO Andre van der Veen", "title_full": "Interview: eMedia Holdings CEO Andre van der Veen", "published": "2018-10-11T05:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11938f8b69382cc1883a0b90911b8fd30d952f7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2Tug8Wsin2GM8E5QinzvRFUV8g3l9.LhM_XGFPYg5iivY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-10-11T05:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Interview: eMedia Holdings CEO Andre van der Veen", "text": "The Autonomous Revolution: here to help, not replace Tags", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.africaengineeringnews.com/the-autonomous-revolution-here-to-help-not-replace/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andre van der veen", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T17:33:43.109+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "628c8404a56006434fdbb1661a6d7fd522628fbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2TvhHZLPLwBdLU2PIHzkKXrEam6_AKhrYV8QjH5xznPYbLHX6dy2E4vg--", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://conservativeangle.com/?feed=linkfeed", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "Conservative Angle | Link Feed", "title": "A flood of fake installers will really update Flash for you \u2013 but also install cryptocurrency mining malware", "title_full": "A flood of fake installers will really update Flash for you \u2013 but also install cryptocurrency mining malware", "published": "2018-10-11T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "628c8404a56006434fdbb1661a6d7fd522628fbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2TvhHZLPLwBdLU2PIHzkKXrEam6_AKhrYV8QjH5xznPYbLHX6dy2E4vg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EdJenner", "published": "2018-10-11T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "A flood of fake installers will really update Flash for you \u2013 but also install cryptocurrency mining malware", "text": "Go to Article\nIf you think that Flash, the once-popular web plugin, couldn\u2019t die fast enough , even those annoying fake Flash installers riddled with malware aren\u2019t going anywhere any time soon. In fact, they\u2019re getting even sneakier.\nNew research out of Palo Alto Networks found a recent spike of fake Flash installers not only dropping cryptocurrency mining malware on vulnerable computers \u2014 but actually installing Flash while it\u2019s there.\nThe researchers said that this new technique is a way to deceive the user by tricking them into thinking that it\u2019s a legitimate Flash installer.\nOnce the installer opens, it quietly implants XMRig , an open source cryptocurrency miner that uses the computer\u2019s processor and graphics card to start mining. All the generated funds are siphoned off to a Monero wallet \u2014 making it near impossible to trace. When the mining malware is implanted, the installer downloads a legitimate Flash installer from Adobe\u2019s website and installs it.\nSince March, the researchers found over a hundred fake Flash updaters alone.\nIt\u2019s a little ironic that Flash, one of the buggiest plugins and most attack prone over the years, is still causing headaches. When Flash wasn\u2019t used as a way to used as a way to push malware on users, hackers were imitating it and using the plugin as a springboard to launch their own fake attacks. Flash became so much of a problem that Google began sandboxing Flash (and other plugins) in Chrome almost a decade ago because Flash-based malware was so prevalent.\nBut since the rise of the more universally supported and easier to use HTML5, Flash use has rapidly been on the decline.\nAdobe is set to retire Flash in 2020 . Maybe at its demise, we\u2019ll see fewer fake Flash installers too?

So I think as females when we realize that...we can be strong in our career and stuff, but when we are home we have to realize that the man is the head of the house,\" Savage said in the interview. Savage isn't the only Nigerian female celebrity polarizing audiences with her opinions on gender roles and feminism. Nigeria's DJ Cuppy said in an interview with CNN in July : \"I think it's amazing, young females doing what we've been told we can't do and I really feel like women are very powerful.\" Feminists 'doing crazy things' Read More In the same interview, DJ Cuppy acknowledged the difficulties women in Nigeria face, saying \"I had to leave Nigeria to realize my power because a lot of times as a woman you are constricted to what you can do and what you can achieve,\" she said. 'Give African women a voice,' say activists To many Nigerian feminists, Cuppy's comments appeared in-line with feminist ideals. But a month later in an interview with a local radio station , she declared that she doesn't consider herself a feminist anymore. \"I don't like people who are hypocrites. People are out there speaking about women rights, but behind closed doors are doing crazy things,\" she said. \"I would never come out as a feminist because I'm in a male dominated industry so I have certain scenarios where... I deal with men on a day to day basis and I realize they are always going to think they are better than women,\" she added. DJ Cuppy went on to imply that constantly fighting for women's rights wouldn't necessarily lead to a desired change. \"If I literally sat down all day and spoke about how hard it is being a woman I wouldn't have time to be here...because I would be somewhere in Alade market talking about how women need better rights,\" she said. This spurred many comments by Twitter users on topics of gender equality, class privilege and what some consider a fear of the word feminism itself.

However, the views of women who aspire to be in political positions could have a policy impact on the fight for women's rights. So when Eunice Atuejide, a female presidential candidate in Nigeria's 2019 elections, proclaimed that she was \"not a feminist,\" an even fiercer debate ensued. Atuejide said last week on a local radio station that Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the Nigerian author of \"Half of a Yellow Sun,\" is \"an extremist.\" Adichie's book format essay, \"We Should All Be Feminists,\" was given to every 16-year-old in Sweden. But Atuejide said: \"I hope some of our women do not necessarily take on too much of the things she is saying because some of them could actually turn around and bite them in the bum.\" Again, I'm not a feminist!\nI actually hate it when people call me feminist because that word means too many things, many of which I DON'T LIKE!\nEVERYONE should have a fair chance.\nBe yourself and be treated right being yourself\nSo guys, lets caption this picture! #ANigeria4All pic.twitter.com/JPJkebOU3W\n\u2014 Eunice Atuejide (@eunice_atuejide) August 1, 2018 Nigeria's 2019 election comes at a time where gender equality is a global goal the country is still struggling to achieve. The World Economic Forum 2017 Global Gender Gap report ranked Nigeria 122nd out of 144 countries listed. As of 2018, Nigeria still hasn't passed the 2011 Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill -- and has faced criticism for that failure. In a number of Atuejide's tweets, the presidential candidate aired what some branded a myopic view of feminism by reducing the fight for gender equality to cooking. In one tweet, Atuejide asked \"And who is a feminist? My friend who won't cook for her husband & kids cos of equality?\" I'M NOT A FEMINIST!\nNa by force?\nAnd who is a feminist?\nMy friend who won't cook for her husband & kids cos of equality?\nThe one who always insults men bcos she can? Ladies who won't let men hold doors for them cos it diminishes their value? What does feminism mean? #ANigeria4All\n\u2014 Eunice Atuejide (@eunice_atuejide) August 1, 2018 Ayisha Osori, the Nigerian author of \" Love Does Not Win Elections \", responded with some damning statistics on the absence of women in Nigerian politics. \"There are some states in Nigeria like Jigawa, Kebbi and Sokoto that, since 1999, haven't elected a woman for any positions. Federal, state, local -- no woman has been elected,\" Osori told CNN. \"Only five female ministers and deputy governors in the country. We have no female governor, female president or [vice president],\" she added. Given these numbers, Atuejide's views on the importance of feminism are even more puzzling, according to Osori, who believes that Atuejide's decision to run is, in fact, a feminist one. \"Any woman who runs for any leadership role in a very patriarchal system like Nigeria, a country where the representation of women in politics is extremely low,\" Osori said. \"You are a feminist. Not even just by labels, but by what you are trying to achieve -- because you are basically saying, my voice counts, I count as a human being and I have the right to be in this position,\" she added. Africa's feminist history Presidential aspirant Atuejide, in another tweet expressed her \"hate\" for being called a feminist \"because that word means too many things, many of which I don't like.\" Some who question the meaning of feminism in Africa see it as irrelevant in African culture, viewing it as a western import. Minna Salami, a social critic and founder of the pan-African feminist blog, MsAfropolitan, told CNN: \"There is a history of feminist movements in Africa and one notable chapter in Nigeria was the Aba Women's Riots of 1929.\" This particular movement was led by women in southeastern Nigeria as a revolt against policies imposed by British colonialists. Some who question the meaning of feminism in Africa see it as irrelevant in African culture, viewing it as a western import . Atuejide, 40, a lawyer, is one of six women running for the highest office in Nigeria's 2019 elections. Eunice Atuejide describes herself as a lawyer, consultant, mother of five. Other female candidates are Nigerian former minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, Olufunmilayo Adesanya-Davis, Elishama Ideh, Adeline Iwuagwu-Emihe, Princess Oyenike Roberts and Remi Sonaiya -- who also contested the 2015 presidential race and was the first Nigerian woman to run for president . Explaining why she took that unprecedented step, Sonaiya told CNN: \"Just the state of the nation. The deplorable state of our public affairs, the inept running of government.\" \"It just struck me that we needed to have good people, people with integrity to get involved in governance. We were wrong to have left our affairs in the hands of people who really had no good intentions for the general populace.\" Sonaiya added. While Sonaiya feels she got support from both male and female citizens, she also received some disapproval as a woman running for office. \"I remember once being on a radio program and one man called in and said 'come and just go back to your kitchen'. But then you remember that our President himself had said that his wife belonged to the kitchen and to 'the other room'. But this did not affect me one way or the other. \"I was focused on my running and I expected that there would be different opinions about what I was doing,\" said Sonaiya. Women in South Africa are marching against gender violence with #TotalShutdown protest Sonaiya is referencing President Muhammadu Buhari's comments from 2016, when he said his wife belonged \"to my kitchen and my living room and the other room.\" This was as a response to her criticism of his leadership, where she suggested she might not vote for him in the next election . \"He is yet to tell me but I have decided, as his wife, that if things continue like this up to 2019, I will not go out and campaign again and ask any woman to vote like I did before. I will never do it again,\" said Aisha Buhari. Women in khimars wait in line to cast their votes at a polling staion in Daura, Katsina State, northern Nigeria during presidential elections. Women's race for president Three years after Sonaiya's run for president, more Nigerian women are following her lead. Although just not under the banner of feminism, or even gender. Atuejide campaign slogan is \"A Nigeria For All\" and she claims she has a plan to promote equality: \"by allowing people to compete in the same conditions, \" she said. \"If there are more women than men that are able to do the job then more women than men will be employed and vice versa. And if there is a 50-50 situation that is what we get. But it won't be because of gender.\" Some Nigerians online are wondering who Atuejide is hoping to appeal to during the elections. One Twitter user asked her: \"Well, anti-feminists won't vote you because men are the head and women are the neck/tail. And feminists won't vote a woman who hates the word Feminism. So where does this leave you?\" Atuejide does acknowledge that she faces challenges. \"We have to deal with our religious ways of seeing things,\" she said. \"We have to start making the men, women, children, the imams, the pastors and priests etc... understand that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. That is a challenge that I will have to deal with -- in terms of getting the average Nigerian to cast their vote for me.\" Given the divided social media responses to these women's views on feminism, it is clear that feminism is still considered a controversial subject in Nigeria that will continue to be a hot topic for discussion. But I doubt they would have excluded a feminist from this gathering. \ud83d\ude0a Well, anti-feminists won't vote you because men are the head and women are the neck/tail.

He said disclosing the new plane is a potential deterrence to our enemies.\n\u201cUsually the development of equipment and weaponry of the People\u2019s Liberation Army is highly confidential,\u201d he said.\nShanghai-based news site thepaper.cn said, revealing the bomber\u2019s name before trials show strength in the Chinese aviation industry.\nIn August, state broadcaster China Central Television reported in a documentary that \u201cthe development of new long-distance strategic bomber, Hong-20, had made great progress.\u201d The bomber marked the 91st anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which Chinese officials see the stealth plane as a \u201cgame changer,\u201d could enter series production much sooner than estimated.\nThe documentary was the first time \u201cHong-20\u201d appeared officially in the public domain. \u201cHong\u201d is the first character of Honghaji, \u201cbomber aircraft\u201d in Chinese.\nThe public unveiling of the bomber suggested that Aviation Industry Corp. might have concluded testing of hydraulic pressure, electricity supply, and avionics systems, said song.\n\u201cThe trial flight will come soon,\u201d he added.\nSpecifications of the new bomber are unknown, but it seems the Chinese did a great job copying the profile of the American Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, both look pretty similar.\n\u201cObservers say the design objective is for the long-range H-20 to remain airborne for some 8,000 kilometers to jet away beyond the second island china \u2013 formed by Japan\u2019s Ogasawara and Volcano Islands as well as Guam and the US Mariana Islands in the middle portion of the Pacific \u2014 without aerial refueling,\u201d said Asia Times.\nNews Corp. Australia Network speculated earlier this year that the stealth bomber could reach northern regions of Australia, after taking off from Chinese militarized islands in the South China Sea.\nThe Global Times quoted Fu Qianshao as saying the ultimate goal for the H-20 is to boost operational range to 12,000 kilometers with 20-tons of payload.\nAsia Times pitched the idea that the stealth bomber could be the solution for China to fire missiles at American mainland targets.\nAdd next-generation stealth bombers to the list of military might that China is acquiring before a military conflict with the US breaks out.

Best Silica Gel Multicolor Mini Book light Reading Lamp USB LED Light Computer Lamp for Notebook PC Laptop Reading Night\nThis funding comes on top of Align Technology\u2019s $46.7 million investment in SmileDirectClub in 2016, and another $12.8 million investment in 2017 to own a total of 19 percent of the company.\n\u201cWe are very excited with the outcome of our most recent fundraising round,\u201d SmileDirectClub co-founder Alex Fenkell said in a statement. \u201cOur mission has always been to provide an affordable and convenient option to anyone who wants to transform their smile. We are excited to continue our growth into new spaces and be given the incredible opportunity to reach even more people with our life-changing service,\u201d said Fenkell. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds and are grateful for the support from our new investors.\u201d\nSmileDirectClub is a direct-to-consumer teeth-aligner startup that started with the idea of using teledentistry to virtually connect licensed dentists and orthodontists with people who want to straighten their teeth. Since its inception in 2014, SmileDirectClub says it has helped more than 300,000 people straighten and brighten their teeth. Best Silica Gel Multicolor Mini Book light Reading Lamp USB LED Light Computer Lamp for Notebook PC Laptop Reading Night\nThe company ships invisible aligners directly to customers, and licensed dental professionals (either orthodontists or general dentists) remotely monitor the progress of the patient. Before shipping the aligners, patients either take their dental impressions at home and send them to SmileDirectClub or visit one of the company\u2019s \u201cSmileShops\u201d to be scanned in person. SmileDirectClub says it costs 60 percent less than other types of teeth-straightening treatments, with the length of treatments ranging from four to 14 months. The average treatment lasts six months.\nThough, members of the American Association of Orthodontists have taken issue with SmileDirectClub, previously asserting that SmileDirectClub violates the law because its methods of allowing people to skip in-person visits and X-rays is \u201cillegal and creates medical risks.\u201d The organization has also filed complaints against SmileDirectClub in 36 states, alleging violations of statutes and regulations governing the practice of dentistry. Those complaints were filed with the regulatory boards that oversee dentistry practices and with the attorneys general of each state.\nBack in June, the AAO expressed its disappointment in learning about Macy\u2019s decision to offer SmileDirectClub in some of its locations, saying \u201corthodontic treatment is not a product. Rather, it is a complex medical process.\u201d\nIn the statement, the AAO said \u201cit is in the best interest of consumers to have orthodontic treatment conducted under the direct and ongoing, in-person supervision of a licensed orthodontist.\u201d\nBut SmileDirectClub is not the only startup in this space.

For example, one assessment found that the weapon system satisfactorily prevented unauthorized access by remote users, but not insiders and near-siders. Once they gained initial access, test teams were often able to move throughout a system, escalating their privileges until they had taken full or partial control of a system.\nIn one case, the test team took control of the operators\u2019 terminals. They could see, in real-time, what the operators were seeing on their screens and could manipulate the system. They were able to disrupt the system and observe how the operators responded.\nAnother test team reported that they caused a pop-up message to appear on users\u2019 terminals instructing them to insert two quarters to continue operating .\nMultiple test teams reported that they were able to copy, change, or delete system data including one team that downloaded 100 gigabytes, approximately 142 compact discs, of data.\nWarnings ignored\nDespite years of repeated warnings, cybersecurity surrounding weapons systems has been surprisingly ignored. In 1991, the National Research Council reported \u201c as computer systems become more prevalent , sophisticated, embedded in physical processes, and interconnected, society becomes more vulnerable to poor system design, accidents that disable systems, and attacks on computer systems. Without more responsible design and use, system disruptions will increase, with harmful consequences for society. \u201c\nThe warnings by the GAO began in 1996, when the auditing agency warned that the internet could provide enemies with a cheap and easy method to cause catastrophic damage to connected systems. In 2013, the Defense Science Board warned that \u201cin today\u2019s world of hyper-connectivity and automation, any device with electronic processing, storage, or software is a potential attack point and every system is a potential victim \u2013 including our own weapons systems.\u201d\nPerhaps worst of all ; the GAO claims that despite documented instances of \u201cmission-critical cyber vulnerabilities,\u201d Pentagon officials who met with the GAO testers brushed off their concerns \u2013 insisting that their systems were secure, and \u201cdiscounted some test results as unrealistic.\u201d\nThe GAO acknowledge that the tests were performed on computerized weapons systems that are still under development \u2013 and that hackers are unable to infiltrate current weapons systems in the field. If and when the next-gen weapons are deployed, however, the threat becomes real according to the GAO.\n\u201cIt looks grim unless they see this as a wake-up call and they start taking action in a serious manner,\u201d said GAO employee and co-author of the report, Christina Chaplin.\nAnswering questions in a podcast, Chaplin said that one of the reasons these new computerized weapons systems are so vulnerable to hacks is because, until recently, the DOD didn\u2019t prioritize \u201ccyber\u201d as part of the development process , \u201cbut it has begun to grasp the magnitude of the problem and taken a way of action.\u201d\nOne way was by instituting better testing procedures, and the second was by setting \u201ccyber\u201d as a focus during the acquisition process of the many components part of these new systems.\nBut despite this, the GAO report warns that if the DOD doesn\u2019t act on its own findings to patch the vulnerabilities its employees discover in their own software, then all their internal testing procedures are useless. \u2013 ZDNet\nThe GAO report goes on to call out the DoD for their shoddy response to the vulnerabilities.\nFor example, one test report indicated that only 1 of 20 cyber vulnerabilities identified in a previous assessment had been corrected. The test team exploited the same vulnerabilities to gain control of the system. When asked why vulnerabilities had not been addressed, program officials said they had identified a solution, but for some reason it had not been implemented. They attributed it to contractor error.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a culture right now at the DOD were we feel like the extent of the problem isn\u2019t really appreciated at the program level,\u201d Chaplin said. \u201cThe DOD has a lot of work ahead of it to overcome some cultural issues.\u201d\nWhile the GAO doesn\u2019t specify the weapons systems involved out of national security concerns, they did say that the systems are heavily computerized and many of them networked together \u2013 making them attractive targets for enemies of the United States after they are deployed in the field.\n\u201c Nearly every conceivable component in DOD is networked ,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWeapon systems connect to DOD\u2019s extensive set of networks\u2013called the DOD Information Network\u2013and sometimes to external networks, such as those of defense contractors. Technology systems, logistics, personnel, and other business-related systems sometimes connect to the same networks as weapon systems. Furthermore, some weapon systems may not connect directly to a network, but connect to other systems, such as electrical systems, that may connect directly to the public Internet.\u201d\nWe wonder how vulnerable China or Russia\u2019s next-gen weapons systems are?

But the subject continued to dominate much of the discussion in council chambers.\nTalk focused on three back-to-back events this week, beginning with an open house scheduled from 5:30-7 p.m. today at the East High School atrium, 301 N. 40th Ave. E.\nInitially, the gatherings had been described as an opportunity for community members to weigh in on a draft policy governing when and how local police could use such equipment.\nBut after concerns about the format were brought to the city's attention, the events have been reframed, as Keith Hamre, Duluth's interim chief administrative officer, explained to city councilors Monday.\nThe change brings the community meetings more in line with the recommendations of the Duluth Citizens Review Board, according to 2nd District Councilor Joel Sipress. He noted that the board had suggested the discussion should cover not only a possible policy but also should \"gather input and feedback on the potential purchase and deployment of protective gear.\"\nHamre assured Sipress that both items would be on the agenda for the gatherings and said the city would update its Facebook posting to reflect that broader scope.\nRyan Jones-Casey, a citizen opposed to the proposed equipment purchase, said: \"I'm dismayed by the official characterization of the upcoming open houses focused on riot gear.\"\nHe criticized the way the city initially rolled out the events, saying: \"At best, the city press release and Facebook event descriptions are confusing and misleading, damaging the process and the legitimacy of these forums. At worst, the information shared has been deliberately crafted to frame the events in a way that suggests the riot gear purchase decision has already been made, and the attempt to gather the public's input on this decision is not at all in earnest.\"\nJones-Casey called on the city to clarify the broader ground to be covered at the open houses, as Hamre pledged to do.\nHamre said the events are intended \"to give everyone an ample opportunity to provide information in a comfortable setting and space, versus getting into a town hall meeting where it gets very emotional and there's a lot of passion.\"\nThe Citizens Review Board met for four hours Wednesday to discuss the proposed equipment purchase and heard quite a bit of testimony, Hamre said. Earlier in the week, the City Council also listened to dozens of speakers on the same subject before moving to table the request.\n\"Everybody has a lot to say about this resolution, and I think we want to make sure we gather that input as best we can, but we also want to make sure that it's a safe space,\" Hamre said.\nDuring the open houses, people will be able to submit written comments and mark up sample policies, according to a city press release.\nHamre said the gear resolution could return for the City Council's consideration as soon as Oct 22.\nIn addition to the open house at East tonight, two other events are slated this week: 5:30-7 p.m. Wednesday in the Denfeld High School cafeteria, 401 N. 44th Ave. W. 5:30-7 p.m. Thursday at Historic Old Central High School, 215 N. First Ave. E.\nIn other business Monday night, the Duluth City Council repealed a section of the city code that held city workers responsible for removing snow that plows pushed onto people's sidewalks.\nLeft unamended, the code was unworkable, explained 3rd District Councilor Em Westerlund.\n\"It's unfortunate that we don't have the capacity to do what we've had on the books as part of our snow management over the past many years,\" she said.\n\"I do think it's important we make this change so that the public does not feel that the city has a law that we ourselves are not able to follow through on in executing,\" Westerlund said. \"While it might look like we're taking something away, I think it's just a more accurate reflection of what's been happening in practice for many years,\" she said.\nThe amended ordinance passed on a 7-1 vote, with 5th District Councilor Jay Fosle opposed and 1st District Councilor Gary Anderson absent due to a prior commitment.

There is uncertainty over the future of manager Jose Mourinho, talk of player unrest, reports of leaks from within to the media, and distinguished ex-players have been venting their ire.\nFormer striker Louis Saha admits all is not well at Old Trafford, that the situation is \"not normal\" and that everyone at the club is to blame for the torrid start to the season. Follow @cnnsport \"It has been intense. They [the players] seem lost,\" Saha, signed by Alex Ferguson from Fulham for $16.40 million in 2004, tells CNN Sport. \"Right now, there's not enough connection.\" United has lost three of its opening eight games in the English Premier League, while ahead of the team's home match against Newcastle on Saturday -- which United went on to win 3-2 thanks to a thrilling comeback in the last 20 minutes -- there were reports in British newspapers that Mourinho was set to be sacked after the match. Asked whether there was a problem at the club, the Frenchman -- who earned 20 international caps for his country -- replied: \"Yes, when there is no result of course there is things to change and everyone is to blame. The players, the staff, they have to do more. It's not about one game or two, it's about being consistent. Read More \"They may lose some games, but we should not have anyone questioning desire. It should not happen.\" READ: What's wrong at Manchester United? Saha won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with United Gary Neville, a former United teammate of Saha's, has described the club as being \"rotten to the core,\" and blamed executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and other board members of surrendering too much power to players and allowing \"the tail to wag the dog.\" The relationship between Mourinho and the club's record signing Paul Pogba has come under increasing scrutiny . Pogba has been criticized by many for talking to much to the media, while the manager has told the France World Cup winner he will not captain United again and last month the pair shared a frosty exchange during training. \"If Gary Neville thinks there's something wrong I think you have to listen,\" added Saha, who went on to play for Everton and Sunderland after leaving United in 2008. \"People will talk about Pogba and Mourinho. They are actors. They [the players] have to understand they have to be at their best. They all have the answers. \"There is things going on in the press, distracting from the way they are playing. This is not normal. \"Sometimes at manager level as well I think there are game decision that have been wrong, but millions of fans have an opinion. We don't know, what we can see is on the field.\" Pogba has been criticized for talking too much in the media Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videos Saha said players needed protecting from the media, admitting it was a surprise that a club of United's stature was not looking after its image and not appearing to help players in the digital age. The leaks to the media of impending sackings and player unrest, the 40-year-old Saha said, would be affecting the squad. He said: \"It's all changed now, it's social networks, there's a lot of media for sponsors ... If you play with that it can backfire sometimes. You have to be careful. \"It's about getting the actual image of the players and the club in the best way possible and I don't think it's been done. \"If people are talking this way something is wrong. I see information, leaks, it's not normal. Whoever is trying to deal with that of course will have to punish because this is not normal. \"And it does, of course, [affect the squad].

Members of Nurmagomedov's team also launched their own assault on the beaten McGregor. Three men were reportedly arrested but later released after the Irishman refused to press charges. Khabib Nurmagomedov of Russia is escorted out of the arena after defeating Conor McGregor. While Nurmagomedov apologised for his actions, he pointed to McGregor's verbal barbs in trying to explain what happened in the fight's aftermath. \"I don't understand how people can talk about how I jump on the cage,\" Nurmagomedov said during a post-bout media conference. \"He [McGregor] talked about my religion, he talked about my country, he talked about my father. He came to Brooklyn and he broke a bus, he almost killed a couple of people.\" In July, McGregor pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in exchange for a community service to resolve charges relating to the Irishman and others attacking a bus carrying UFC fighters in Brooklyn. \"This is a respectful sport, not a trash-talking sport,\" added Nurmagomedov.

Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videos Trash Talk In the run-up to the fight, the 30-year-old McGregor had spoken about Nurmagomedov's Islamic faith, nationality and family in less that complimentary terms. He labeled Nurmagomedov's manager a \"snitch terrorist rat\" and called his father a \"coward\" for associating with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Conor McGregor sits on the mat in the octagon after being defeated by Khabib Nurmagomedov by submission. White was quick to condemn the ugly scenes, but he dismissed claims that the UFC should have stepped in to temper McGregor's personal attacks. \"This isn't the last time guys are going to say mean things to each other,\" White said in a press conference . \"People have been saying mean things to each other for 18 years here in the UFC. Nothing like this has ever happened.\" Bus incident Footage of McGregor throwing a two-wheeled dolly into a bus window in that Brooklyn incident was also used to advertise the bout with Nurmagomedov.

I know these people, I know they're lily-livered, and as long as it looks good on the surface, to them, that's enough.\" Read More McGowan later clarified her reported remarks. \"I never said #MeToo is a lie. Ever,\" McGowan wrote in a tweet on Sunday. I never said #MeToo is a lie. Ever. I was talking about Hollywood and Time's Up, not #MeToo . Ugh.

markets entered Wednesday in tentative fashion as US Treasury yields resumed their upward march after dropping the day before ahead of a closely watched US CPI report and as the US Treasury prepared to sell more debt to fund the soaring US deficit.\nThe mood in stocks soured, and European equities turned lower with American futures as Asian peers erased an advance while world stocks inched off eight-week lows; market gains were checked by fears for global economic growth, greater US decoupling, escalating trade war and the possibility of an Italy-EU clash over budget spending. The result was generally a sea of red among global capital markets in early trading.\nThe equity rout that resulted from the global bond selloff that took bond yields to seven-year highs this week were exacerbated by continued growth concerns arising from trade conflicts and $80-per-barrel oil, with the IMF cutting its world GDP forecasts for the first time in two years.\nThe yield on 10-year Treasurys resumed its ascent to 3.23% from 3.20%, after falling for the first time in a week on Tuesday, putting a lid on early trader optimism.\n\u201cWe are at some sort of critical moment, a crossroads, for bond and equity markets,\u201d Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management, said noting that while U.S. 10-year yields at 2% unequivocally favored equity investment, this was not so above 3%. \u201cThis January we took out the 2 percent (yield) handle and now we are wondering if we are permanently taking out the 3 percent handle as well. That makes the climate for equities much more challenging.\u201d\nThe MSCI world equity index rose 0.14% after four days in the red. However, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei and MSCI\u2019s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose 0.2-0.3 percent, European shares slipped 0.2 percent, undermined by more bellicose rhetoric from Italian politicians.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped as most sectors turned lower. The European basic resources index (SXPP) \u2013 which was one of the best-performing sectors since the end of August \u2013 fell as much as 2.2%, one of Wednesday\u2019s main sector laggards, as investors rotated toward defensive sub-groups including telecoms and health care. Milan-listed stocks traded between gains and losses, rising off 18-month lows hit earlier in the week.\nEurope\u2019s weakness followed a modest recovery of bullish sentiment in Asia, as shares in Japan rose after four days of losses, South Korean equities slumped as trading resumed after a holiday while those in China closed 0.2% higher after fluctuating between gains and losses before edging barely up after early gains slipped with lithium-related stocks tumbling, while Tencent suffered a record ninth day of declines in Hong Kong.\nThe retreat in emerging markets took a pause on Wednesday after Donald Trump said the Fed is moving too fast on rate hikes and as traders awaited U.S. inflation data before taking a stance on riskier assets . Equities slowed their drop and currencies eked out their first gain this week, led by India\u2019s rupee\nThe yuan slipped against the dollar for the fifth session out of the past six to approach four-year lows hit in August, unresponsive to Mnuchin\u2019s warning on devaluation. The focus is on next week\u2019s semi-annual U.S. report on currencies amid Treasury officials\u2019 comments that recent yuan depreciation has raised concerns in Washington.\nThe backdrop to global markets is still dominated by deepening U.S.-China tensions and a surge in volatility for stock and bond markets. While the Treasury rout has eased, a glut of new U.S. debt is coming to the market this week. American producer and consumer price data is also due in the next two days, and may determine where yields go from here.\n\u201cAfter President Trump once again criticized the Fed for raising rates too fast and he reiterated his preference for low borrowing costs, U.S. bond yields fell from their recent highs,\u201d Rabobank strategist Piotr Matys wrote in a note. \u201cThis in turn provided the emerging-market currencies with respite. However, looking from the perspective of technical analysis the price action implies that U.S. 10-year Treasuries have entered a period of consolidation.\u201d\nItalian bonds initially dropped and bear flattened beyond the belly after Deputy PMs Salvini and Di Maio said the budget plan won\u2019t change and there\u2019s no going back, suggesting an unwillingness to compromise. Italy\u2019s 10y spread to Germany blew out to 305bps, after Di Maio said that \u201cour objective is not the spread, but the citizen\u2026 We expect that the economic growth rate will be higher\u201d with measures included in the next year\u2019s budget plan.\nHowever the initial weakness reversed in a repeat of Tuesday\u2019s action after Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, speaking before the parliament\u2019s joint budget committee, pledged action to restore calm should market turbulence escalate into financial crisis. Yields slipped further after Tria said he expected \u201ccollaboration\u201d with the EU on the budget issue, and added that \u201cthe rise in government bond yields recorded in the last few days is certainly a reason for concern, but I want to reiterate that it was an excessive reaction which is not justified by the fundamentals of Italy\u2019s economy and public finances.\u201d\nThat said, markets\u2019 pressure has not dissuaded the government from a bigger-than-expected budget deficit as ministers\u2019 comments indicated they are prepared to defy European Union critics. The developments have raised risks of a credit ratings downgrade for the country, with a knock-on effect for Italian banks which are big holders of government bonds. However the banks\u2019 shares received a boost after an EU official told Reuters regulators were \u201cintensely\u201d monitoring Italian banks\u2019 liquidity levels but there was no cause for alarm.\n\u201cI am not saying Italy is managing the situation in an ideal fashion but at the current junction I don\u2019t think they are anywhere near a position where they can provoke another crisis in Europe,\u201d Owens Thomsen said.\nIn currencies, the dollar reversed an early decline, rising to session highs, tracking Treasury yields, while another drop in Italian bonds kept the euro under pressure. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index heads for its third straight weekly advance as Treasury 10-year yields hold close to cycle highs and the euro meets selling interest on rallies above 1.15.\nPolitics were also in focus in Britain where reports of progress between the UK and the EU in negotiating a Brexit deal pushed the pound to 3-1/2-month highs against the dollar. Analysts at Eurizon SLJ Capital said parliamentary approval looked likely for Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The Times newspaper reported 30-40 opposition Labour MPs would back the agreement. \u201cAlready significantly undervalued, sterling has upside risks, especially against the euro,\u201d Eurizon SLJ told clients, arguing that $1.55 was \u201cfair value\u201d for the currency.\nThe krone led gains in G-10 on stronger Norwegian inflation. Sterling hits its strongest level in two weeks on hopes officials will reach a compromise Brexit deal that could see the U.K. remain temporarily in the EU\u2019s customs regime; wider than forecast trade deficit data helps push the pound back toward its opening level. The South African rand dropped following Tuesday\u2019s rally.\nIn geopolitics, US President Trump said a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un will be after US midterm elections on November 6th. In related news, US Secretary of State Pompeo noted real progress on his trip to North Korea and sees a full path to denuclearization.\nIn the latest Brexit news, ITV reported that UK PM May\u2019s negotiator Robbins has made meaningful progress in talks with EU\u2019s Chief Negotiator Barnier on the Irish border backstop. The article stated, \u201cThe most important development would be that the EU seems close to agreeing that the backstop would apply to the whole UK and not just to Northern Ireland, as it originally demanded \u2013 or at least it would apply to the whole UK for customs.\u201d (ITV) In related news, UK Brexit Minister Raab said the UK will not sign up to an indefinite customs union with the backstop and negotiations with the EU have intensified, some differences on the withdrawal agreement.\nIn commodities, WTI slipped but was still near $75 a barrel as Hurricane Michael curtailed offshore oil production and the IEA issued a warning to the global market.\nExpected data include mortgage applications, PPIs, and wholesale inventories. Fastenal is among companies reporting earnings.\nMarket Snapshot S&P 500 futures down 0.1% to 2,885.25 STOXX Europe 600 down 0.3% to 371.92 MXAP up 0.02% to 157.41 MXAPJ down 0.05% to 492.53 Nikkei up 0.2% to 23,506.04 Topix up 0.2% to 1,763.86 Hang Seng Index up 0.08% to 26,193.07 Shanghai Composite up 0.2% to 2,725.84 Sensex up 1.3% to 34,758.76 Australia S&P/ASX 200 up 0.1% to 6,049.81 Kospi down 1.1% to 2,228.61 German 10Y yield rose 0.2 bps to 0.551% Euro down 0.01% to $1.1490 Italian 10Y yield fell 9.0 bps to 3.104% Spanish 10Y yield rose 1.1 bps to 1.611% Brent futures down 0.2% to $84.82/bbl Gold spot down 0.2% to $1,187.48 U.S. Dollar Index up 0.1% to 95.76\nTop Overnight News from Bloomberg Republican groups have been pulling back in more than a half dozen tough House races to focus their resources in districts where they see a better chance to defend against a building midterm surge by Democrats China plans to increase the number of companies it deems systemically important financial institutions, people familiar with the matter said, a sign that policy makers are stepping up crisis-prevention efforts as the nation\u2019s debt burden swells to unprecedented levels Mnuchin warns China on competitive currency devaluations; Treasury has monitored currency issues \u201cvery carefully\u201d; notes yuan has \u201cdepreciated significantly\u201d during the year: FT Italy: Finance Minister Tria says budget watchdog approved govt economic forecast, however had different view on growth targets; rise in BTP yields are an excessive reaction BOE\u2019s Haldane: risks to domestic prices are now broadly balanced; U.K. wage growth is likely to be limited and gradual Brexit: a group of 30-40 Labour MPs are prepared to back Chequers deal, according to people familiar: Times ECB\u2019s Mersch: tightening labor market should support core inflation; reiterates ECB will be data dependent British and European Union officials are locked in talks in Brussels over a compromise Brexit deal that could see the U.K. remain temporarily in the EU\u2019s customs regime, people familiar with the negotiations said There are growing signs China\u2019s yuan may weaken past 7 per dollar, a key psychological level it hasn\u2019t breached in a decade.

The Dow closed in the red as the major indices swung between positive and negative territory throughout the day. ASX 200 (+0.3%) was supported by strength in the healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors, while Nikkei 225 (Unch) was pressured by machinery names along with Softbank after reports emerged that the company discussed investing between USD 15bln-20bln for a majority stake in WeWork, while a firmer currency only subdued the index further. Elsewhere, mixed trade in China with Hang Seng (+0.5%) supported by oil names, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) gave up initial gains to trade with no firm direction for most of the session before stabilising in the red.\nTop Asian News China\u2019s Banking Showdown Pits WeChat vs. 3 Million Bank Tellers Rocket Scientist\u2019s Veggie Startup Is Said Valued at $7 Billion Hong Kong Bans E-Cigarettes in Latest Blow for Big Tobacco SoftBank Is Said to Consider Taking a Majority Stake in WeWork Luxury Shoppers in China Still Buy Bags, But Not BMWs Singapore Central Banker Strikes Upbeat Tone Amid Trade Risk\nMajor European indices (ex-SMI) trade lower (Eurostoxx 50 -0.4%) as Italian budgetary concerns remain a key focus; SMI. The CAC 40 (-0.7%) lags its peers after being weighed on by the Luxury names after the sector was downgraded to underweight by Morgan Stanley with the US bank citing concerns about a slowdown in Chinese activity.

To recap, the broad Dollar and DXY recoiled from best levels in relatively quick order, with the index down to 95.500 vs 96.000+ and circa 95.750 now, as rival currencies also derived bullish momentum on independent factors. The JPY is back below 113.00 vs the Usd and still unable to really test a key Fib level at 112.73, but perhaps drawn towards decent option interest from the big figure to 113.05 (1.2 bn) if the headline pair fails to break above 113.25. Some retracement from peaks for the Zar after a broadly positive reaction to the new SA Finance Minister appointment, while in contrast the Try has pared losses following initial disappointment over the Turkish Government\u2019s inflation-fighting measures.\nIn commodities, both WTI and Brent are down just under 0.5%, trading just under USD 75/bbl and USD 85/bbl following further supply shortages from Hurricane Michael with 40% of Gulf of Mexico production now suspended in preparation.

By late morning London time 10yr yields had climbed another 14bps to 3.711%. However by the close we were almost 10bps tighter on the day at 3.476%. An impressive turnaround. Yields seemed to start to fall at the same time as the following headlines came through from Tria\u2019s parliamentary hearing. He said that the \u201cGovernment would act in case of an unexpected rise in bond spreads,\u201d and that Italy\u2019s current government bond yield spread is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and hopes to bring it down by explaining the budget measures. To be fair, this was all very vague and it\u2019s not clear what the government could do other than reduce the budget deficit \u2013 which he hasn\u2019t had much power over in the first place. Nevertheless the rally had started and seemed to get a further leg when headlines came through that \u201cConte, Tria, Salvini and Di Maio to meet at 8pm over budget.\u201d We haven\u2019t seen any follow through on this but Tria will address parliament at 10AM local time today.\nIf BTP trading required a seatbelt yesterday, Treasury and Bund markets required a small dose of motion sickness pills as 10yrs traded to both sides of a 6bp and 4bps range respectively. Given the risk off of the last few days and the weak global day for risk across the US bond market holiday on Monday, it was a bit of a surprise to see US Treasuries sell off 3bps in the morning to nearly 3.26%. However, we closed 3.0bps lower at 3.203% (3.208% in Asia). Bunds closed largely unchanged.\nUS equities were mixed again, though the recent underperformers bounced, with the NYFANG index up +0.63% and the NASDAQ eking out a +0.03% gain after 3 sessions of losses over which time it had shed -3.60%. The S&P 500 and DOW fell -0.14% and -0.21% respectively, while the VIX index rose as much as 1.8pts, but fell throughout the evening to close only 0.26pts higher at 15.95. That\u2019s still a 3-month high.\nThis morning in Asia markets are continuing to trade mixed with the Hang Seng (+0.43%) up while the Shanghai Comp (-0.18%), Nikkei (-0.09%) and Kospi (-1.10%) are all down. Elsewhere, futures on S&P 500 (-0.15%) are pointing to a slightly softer start while EM FX is generally stronger against the greenback. On oil, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol made a direct appeal to OPEC and other major oil producers to boost output, warning that high prices are inflicting damage on the global economy at a time when global economy is already losing growth momentum.\nThe pound rallied 0.41% versus the dollar yesterday on positive-sounding headlines, with Dow Jones reporting that the EU and UK will agree to a solution on the Northern Ireland issue at next week\u2019s EU Council meeting. Separately, Brexit Secretary Raab told Parliament that the backstop for Northern Ireland will be temporary and limited. It\u2019s hard to see how this will satisfy the EU but the headlines over the last 24 hours suggest we getting closer to a deal. The DUP\u2019s Arlene Foster reiterated that on the Northern Ireland border issue they are trying to find a deal that works for everyone which sounded a little more dovish while the Government\u2019s spokesman James Slack said that the UK\u2019s new proposal for how to prevent a hard border with Ireland is coming \u201cin due course,\u201d signaling that the government expects the EU to flesh out how it sees UK\u2019s future ties with the EU. In the meantime, The Times reported that the UK PM Theresa May is planning to have an extended discussion on Brexit at next Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting in hopes of outlining a compromise deal on the Irish border. Overall, our strategists remain cautious, since the actual agreement of the deal will not be the key stumbling block; the real issue is if a deal can pass through Parliament. Positive movement from Labour MPs or from \u201chard\u201d Brexiteers would be a more bullish catalyst for the pound. Interestingly the FT reports this morning that up to 30 Labour MPs are assessing whether they would vote against the government if it meant a no-deal.\nIn terms of central bank speak, the Fed\u2019s Kaplan said on inflation that the cyclical inflation pressures are building and didn\u2019t think that inflation is going to \u201crun away from us\u201d On rates he reiterated his previous view that he is comfortable hiking rates three more times till June while adding that higher productivity could lift neutral interest rates. He also added that I \u201cdon\u2019t know the answer yet\u201d on whether the U.S. central bank should lift interest rates past the neutral level that neither spurs nor slows growth, or \u201csit tight for a while.\u201d Philadelphia Fed President Harker continued his recent hawkish shift by describing the labour market as having \u201cvery little slack left.\u201d Overnight the Fed\u2019s John Williams said that he expects the US economy to grow by c.3% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019 while adding that the above trend growth should lead to decline in unemployment levels to slightly below 3.5% in 2019. On inflation he said he expects it to move a bit above 2% but doesn\u2019t see any signs of greater inflationary pressures on the horizon.\nEmerging market currencies gained 0.32% yesterday, amid positive news in Turkey and South Africa. Turkey\u2019s treasury and finance minister Berat Albayrak announced a new plan to cut inflation, including price controls/cuts and lower bank loan rates. The Turkish lira erased morning declines to close 0.26% stronger. In South Africa, Finance Minister Nene resigned after a corruption scandal and was replaced by Tito Mboweni, a former central bank governor. Mboweni has a strong reputation as an orthodox inflation hawk, and the markets greeted the new appointment with the Rand rallying 1.88% versus the dollar. The Brazilian Real also outperformed, gaining 1.74% for its 7th consecutive day of gains. It has now appreciated every day in October, as investors anticipate a victory by rightwing candidate Bolsonaro in the October 28 runoff Presidential election.\nIn Europe, Germany\u2019s August trade balance came in at \u20ac17.2bn (vs. \u20ac16.2bn expected) while the current account balance stood at \u20ac15.3bn (vs. \u20ac16.2bn expected). German exports declined -0.1% mom (vs. +0.4% mom expected) for the second month in a row, however the decline in imports was more accentuated at -2.7% mom (vs. -0.1% mom expected). In the US, the NFIB small business confidence fell modestly from its all-time high of 108.8 in August, printing at 107.9 versus expectations for 108.3.\nLooking ahead to today, August industrial production will print in the UK and France. After a soft reading in Germany, the stakes are marginally higher than normal. The UK will also have its monthly GDP reading and trade balance report. In the US, focus will be on the September PPI report ahead of Thursday\u2019s CPI, as well as August wholesale inventories data. Brexit negotiations will remain in focus, the BoE\u2019s Chief Economist Haldane will speak in London, and regional Fed Presidents Bostic and Evans will speak on the economic outlook later in the evening.

It was actually not their first time coming face-to-face. Lewinsky told the crowd that she had gone to see Gadsby's show over the summer and reacted viscerally. \"I have never gone to a standup comedy show and bawled my eyes out as much as I did,\" she told Gadsby. \"And given my history, that was pretty surprising.\" Read More In \"Nanette,\" Gadsby criticizes comedians who made Lewinsky their target instead of former President Bill Clinton, \"the man who abused his power,\" Gadsby says in the special. \"I really want to thank you for that,\" Lewinsky said. \"On social media, actually, I've noticed, even if people don't reference 'Nanette', there have been many more people who have referenced their regret at having seen me at just a punchline. I think that comes from what you put into the world.\" Lewinsky's voice wavered as she thanked Gadsby. \"When we have an easy punchline, I think we have to acknowledge that we're dehumanizing actual human beings,\" said Gadsby, who added that meeting Lewinsky was \"an amazing moment\" because she felt her message had gotten through. \"It was a genuine attempt to extend an apology from an art form that profited off shaming you,\" Gadsby said. \"And there's so many people like that.\" Gadsby pointed to the late Amy Winehouse as another example. \"[She] was a person we found so easy to laugh at in the midst of witnessing something quite devastating, and we keep doing this and we have to work out ways [to change it].\" Netflix does not release ratings data, but Gadsby's special has spurred many conversations since its June debut on the streaming service, from debates about comedy content to whether the at-times emotionally heavy show counts as comedy at all. Though she had been a popular figure in other markets before her special, its release catapulted Gadsby into a new realm of awareness in American pop culture. Gadsby admitted she finds the increased attention \"very foreign.\" \"I find (it) uncomfortable,\" she said. She sees some limits on her newfound popularity in the states, however. When asked whether she would ever host \"Saturday Night Live,\" Gadsby said, \"It's not a real question because I won't be asked.\" Why, Lewinsky asked. \"I'm not a friend of them. They're not fans of my work,\" she said. \"It's fine.

The public is encouraged to attend the meetings and ask questions of CFPUA staff.\n\"We know our current treatment technology is unable to remove PFAS from the water and information on the health effects of these compounds remains limited,\" CFPUA said in a news release. \"Still, public health experts agree that reducing exposure to these compounds is beneficial.\n\"Upgrades to an advanced treatment facility like the Sweeney Plant are costly. The combined costs of our interim solution and the permanent solution would exceed $46 million \u2014 an expense we do not believe our community should have to pay.\"\nA pilot study at the Sweeney Plant has shown installing a granular activated carbon filtration system would reduce PFAS in finished drinking water. On Oct. 10, the CFPUA board approved the design contract for a new carbon filtration system.\nThe utility filed a lawsuit in October 2017 against Chemours and DuPont and is asking for a full recovery of all the money it has spent to address the issue of PFAS in the drinking water.\nCopyright 2018 WECT .

Additionally, as Bloomberg notes, we\u2019ve swung from fears of tank bottoms at the Cushing storage hub to concerns about how quickly it\u2019ll grow\u2026\nWTI sunk below $72 ahead of the DOE data, heading for the biggest 2-day drop since July, and held those losses on the crude build\u2026\n\u201cThe oil market can not shield itself from the rout in equity markets,\u201d said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Zurich.\nMeanwhile, WCS settled at $26.17/bbl, lowest at close since August 2016, pushing Western Canada Select\u2019s discount to West Texas Intermediate crude to $52 a barrel on Tuesday, the widest on record\u2026\nThe plunge in Canadian crude prices may dent exploration budgets and shrink the nation\u2019s rig fleet, according to the chief executive officer of a major drilling contractor. The discount on Canadian crude will hammer cash flow, Precision Drilling Corp. CEO Kevin Neveu said at an event in Calgary.\nWith Canada\u2019s debt and equity markets \u201calmost closed\u201d to energy producers, cash is the sole source of funding for drilling, he said.\n\u201cIf cash flows get crimped back on a quarterly basis or a daily basis by the widening differential, they would adjust their rig counts sometimes even weekly,\u201d Neveu said.\nHowever, there is a silver lining as The National Post reports, Chinese oil buyers are making a beeline for a bargain across the Pacific.\nWith Canadian oil over 60 per cent cheaper than U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and global marker Brent, China\u2019s refiners are being lured to the heavy and sludgy crude. That\u2019s because, apart from being a source of fuel, it\u2019s also rich in bitumen \u2013 a black residue used to build everything from roads to runways and roofs.\n\u201cThe policy of boosting infrastructure investment has been bullish for bitumen,\u201d said Li Haining, an analyst with industry consultant SCI99 in China\u2019s Shandong province. \u201cThe supply of the Merey grade has been disrupted since May, pushing refiners to look elsewhere. As late-September and October is traditionally the peak season for construction projects in China, demand will be further supported.\u201d\nApart from Canada, China has also turned to producers such as Brazil for alternatives, said WengInn Chin, a senior oil market analyst at industry consultant FGE in Singapore. Demand for heavy crude is particularly high among the Asian nation\u2019s independent refiners, known as teapots.

Markets head for more losses: US stock futures were lower, pointing to another day of losses on Wall Street.\nTech stocks including Facebook ( FB ), Apple ( AAPL ), Snap ( SNAP ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) were among the biggest losers in premarket trading. Meanwhile, a sharp drop in US stocks on Wednesday spread to global markets. The pain was most severe in Asia, where benchmark indexes in Hong Kong and Tokyo shed over 3.5%. The Shanghai Composite closed down 5.2%. European markets opened with losses of roughly 1%. Read More On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 832 points, or 3.2%. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% and the Nasdaq tumbled 4.1%. 2. The blame game: Analysts say a combination of factors, including higher interest rates and worries about the trade war, were responsible for the sell-off. US rates have risen rapidly, which led to spiking bond yields. As bonds become more attractive to investors looking for returns, stocks suffer. Some think the Federal Reserve is too aggressive in its approach. President Donald Trump is one of them He blasted the cent on Wednesday as \"crazy.\" \"The Fed is making a mistake,\" Trump told reporters as he arrived for a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. \"They're so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.\" However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he didn't think the Federal Reserve triggered the rout in US stocks. He called the market drop \"a normal correction.\" \"I don't think there was any new news that came out of the Fed today that wasn't there beforehand,\" Mnuchin said Thursday morning in an interview in Bali, Indonesia. 3. BMW in China: BMW ( BAMXF ) is taking control over its business in China, the first international carmaker to do so since the Chinese government moved earlier this year to relax ownership restrictions. The German company said it will pay \u20ac3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to take control over its joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. Its stake will increase by 25% to 75%, and the deal is expected to close in 2022. 4. Volatile oil: US oil futures dropped 1.1% to trade at $72.30 per barrel. Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday showed US inventories grew more than expected. The report came amid widespread outages in oil production in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael. 5.

His firm specializes in hardware security and was hired to scan several large data centers belonging to the telecommunications company.\nBloomberg is not identifying the company due to Appleboum\u2019s nondisclosure agreement with the client . Unusual communications from a Supermicro server and a subsequent physical inspection revealed an implant built into the server\u2019s Ethernet connector, a component that\u2019s used to attach network cables to the computer , Appleboum said. \u2013 Bloomberg\nAppleboum says that Super micro \u201cis a victim \u2014 so is everyone else, \u201d and that he has seen \u201csimilar manipulations of different vendors\u2019 computer hardware made by contractors in China,\u201d according to Bloomberg . He adds that his concern is that there are numerous points in the supply chain in China where hardware can be manipulated \u2013 which are virtually impossible to track down. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with the Chinese supply chain,\u201d said Appleboum.\nBased on his inspection of the device, Appleboum determined that the telecom company\u2019s server was modified at the factory where it was manufactured . He said that he was told by Western intelligence contacts that the device was made at a Supermicro subcontractor factory in Guangzhou \u2026 The tampered hardware was found in a facility that had large numbers of Supermicro servers , and the telecommunication company\u2019s technicians couldn\u2019t answer what kind of data was pulsing through the infected one, said Appleboum, who accompanied them for a visual inspection of the machine.\n\u2026\nThe manipulation of the Ethernet connector appeared to be similar to a method also used by the U.S. National Security Agency , details of which were leaked in 2013. In e-mails, Appleboum and his team refer to the implant as their \u201cold friend,\u201d because he said they had previously seen several variations in investigations of hardware made by other companies manufacturing in China. \u2013 Bloomberg\nIn response to the new evidence, Supermicro said in a statement: \u201cThe security of our customers and the integrity of our products are core to our business and our company values. We take care to secure the integrity of our products throughout the manufacturing process, and supply chain security is an important topic of discussion for our industry. We still have no knowledge of any unauthorized components and have not been informed by any customer that such components have been found. We are dismayed that Bloomberg would give us only limited information, no documentation, and half a day to respond to these new allegations .\u201d\nShares of Super Micro dropped as much as 27% in Tuesday trading, and are down approximately 45% since October 3, before the initial Bloomberg story hit the next day.\nSuper Micro strongly refuted the initial Bloomberg report, while both US and UK intelligence officials put out statements over the last several days in support of Amazon, Apple and Super Micro \u2013 who say it never happened.\nAs Bloomberg notes \u2013 the new manipulation is different from the one described last week , however it shares key characteristics: \u201c They\u2019re both designed to give attackers invisible access to data on a computer network in which the server is installed ; and the alterations were found to have been made at the factory as the motherboard was being produced by a Supermicro subcontractor in China.\u201d\nAppleboum said that he\u2019s consulted with intelligence agencies outside the U.S. that have told him they\u2019ve been tracking the manipulation of Supermicro hardware, and the hardware of other companies, for some time. In response to the Bloomberg Businessweek story, the Norwegian National Security Authority said last week that it had been \u201caware of an issue\u201d connected to Supermicro products since June. It couldn\u2019t confirm the details of Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, a statement from the authority said, but it has recently been in dialogue with partners over the issue. \u2013 Bloomberg\nManipulated hardware is extremely difficult to detect, which as led intelligence agencies around the world to invest billions of dollars in such sabotage. The United States is known to have implemented extensive programs to \u201cseed technology headed to foreign countries with spy implants,\u201d according to revelations by former CIA employee Edward Snowden \u2013 however China now appears to be sneaking their own versions onto hardware made within their borders .\nThree security experts who have analyzed foreign hardware implants for the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that the way Sepio\u2019s software detected the implant is sound. One of the few ways to identify suspicious hardware is by looking at the lowest levels of network traffic. Those include not only normal network transmissions, but also analog signals \u2014 such as power consumption \u2014 that can indicate the presence of a covert piece of hardware. \u2013 Bloomberg\nThe goal of the spy implants is to establish a \u201ccovert staging area\u201d within sensitive networks, which is what Appleboum says was happening in the new case. Once the implant was identified and the server removed, Sepio\u2019s tream was unable to perform further analysis on the chip.\nOne problem, according to national security experts, is that in a cybersecurity industry approaching $100 billion in revenue, very little effort has been made to inspect and detect hardware tampering.

During the 2016 campaign, Republicans blasted Hillary Clinton for giving highly paid speeches to corporate audiences after leaving public service.\nIndeed, the Clinton tour follows two years of declining popularity \u2013 between Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic 2016 loss to Donald Trump, and Bill Clinton\u2019s old rape allegations cropping up amid the #MeToo phenomenon.\nVanity Fair writes \u201c The Trump era has not been kind to the Clintons , the prototypical American power couple who, after three decades in the public eye, have seen their political capital vastly diminished. Hillary, indelibly marked by her 2016 election loss, has played only a limited role in the midterms, given the Democratic Party\u2019s newfound aversion to her brand of establishment politics. Bill, meanwhile, has undergone a belated reckoning with #MeToo .\u201d\n[T]he issue of Hillary\u2019s \u201clikability\u201d\u2014as Barack Obama so memorably put it\u2014 is now secondary to the #MeToo scandals hanging over Bill, and the awkward questions she has been forced to address . In a recent interview with CNN, she drew a painstaking line between Bill and the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against the current president, noting, \u201cThere\u2019s a very significant difference, and that is the intense, long-lasting, partisan investigation that was conducted in the 90s. If the Republicans, starting with President Trump on down, want a comparison, they should welcome such an investigation themselves.\u201d That answer may be sufficient for the dwindling number of hardcore Clinton fans, but it is unlikely to win converts. \u2013 Vanity Fair\nTickets for the Clinton tour go on sale Friday.

Follow @cnnsport Vettel's sixth-place finish at Suzuka, after fighting back from an early collision with Max Verstappen, led some observers to suggest he had \"gift-wrapped\" the title for Hamilton. But Mercedes' Hamilton wrote on Instagram : \"I feel the media need to show a little more respect for Sebastian. \"You simply cannot imagine how hard it is to do what we do at our level ... It is to be expected that being humans we will make mistakes but it is how we come through them that counts.\" Read More While the gap between Hamilton and Vettel was as close as 17 points at the Belgian Grand Prix in August, Hamilton's hot streak, coupled with a disappointing set of results for his Ferrari rival, mean the Briton can wrap up his fifth championship title in the U.S. in two weeks' time. Victory for Hamilton in Austin would mean Vettel would have to finish second to keep the title race alive.

Until recently, still fueled by big incentives, the industry hadn\u2019t seen too many meaningful aftershocks of rising interest rates. That\u2019s about to change in a big way (see \u201c Car Sales Tumble As Automakers Slash Discounts For The First Time In 5 Years \u201c).\nLending companies have to pay the difference between the rate they offer customers and the Federal Funds Rate \u2013 as a result, 0% rates simply aren\u2019t a sensible financial option for captive financing companies, or banks, any longer. While some car companies are switching to different types of incentives, like discounted lease rates and rebates, even those are starting to slow.\nSpeaking to the WSJ, Adam Lee, chairman of Maine dealership chain Lee Auto Malls, said that \u201cfor a long time, everything was 0%. At first, buyers could find 0% finance deals on 48-month car loans, and then auto lenders started extending those deals to 60-month loans and eventually 72-month loans. There are fewer and fewer of those deals now.\u201d\nThe report noted that in September, the percentage of new cars that were financed with an interest rate of 1% or under was down to 5.3%, down from 8.2% a year prior and 11.7% two years ago. 0% loans made up for 3.4% of new car financings versus 9.1% two years ago.\nIn addition, the average final financing rate for a new car purchase was 5.75% over the last quarter, which is up from an average of 4.82% two years ago, at a time when the industry was at its strongest. Jack Hollis, general manager of Toyota North America, stated:\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely seeing the entire industry pulling back. Obviously, interest rates rising is a reality in the marketplace, and we\u2019re going to react.\u201d\nLow rates were a major catalyst in helping the automobile industry run hard for almost an entire decade, all the way back to the financial crisis in 2008. The rise in rates means that the average monthly payment for new vehicles will continue to rise, as it has been, according to data provided by Experian.\nDespite this, General Motors still offers no interest loans on a couple of select models, like the Chevy Trax and the Chevy Equinox (suggesting that demand for these cars is less than stellar). An executive from General Motors told the Journal that even though these promotions are more expensive to maintain, they\u2019re not going to \u201cdrop them from their quiver\u201d altogether. The company is simply going to become more selective on which models qualify for low rates, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.\nAdam Lee concluded that \u201cThe higher payments are making it harder for people to afford a new car. Some are going to used [vehicles], some are holding off [on purchases], and some are going to leases.\u201d\nThese rate hikes couldn\u2019t come at a worse time: at the start of the month, we reported that automobile sales in the United States for the month of September were nothing short of awful. Results from Ford, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Fiat all tell the story of an industry grinding to a halt, with few silver linings. Three of these names posted double digit percentage declines in YOY sales and three of them missed analyst estimates.\nHere are the additional low lights from across the industry: Ford posted an 11% drop, missing analyst estimates of 9.1%. The F-Series pickup line ended a 16-month streak of sales gains . Mustang sales were down 1.3%. Nissan posted a 12.2% drop in September. Nissan and Infiniti brand car sales fell by 36%, including a 28% drop for the Altima sedan as the company prepared to start selling an all-new version this week. Toyota sales were down 10.4%, far below estimates of 6.7% for the month. Combined sales for Toyota and Lexus brand cars fell 25.3%. Fiat posted the only true \u201cbeat\u201d, as sales rose 15% versus analyst estimates of 8%. However, the Chrysler brand fell 7% to 14,683 vehicles and the Fiat brand fell 46% to 1,185 vehicles. The deficit was made up on Jeep sales, which were up 14%, as well as sales of Ram pickups and minivans. Volkswagen of America car sales were down 4.8% GM third quarter total sales were down 11%. The company stopped reporting monthly numbers earlier this year, with many suspecting that weakness in the production pipeline is responsible; they were right.\nWith incentives and low rates now both fading out fast, the automobile industry could be in for a grim finish to 2018 and an even worse 2019. Perhaps the only question left at that point will be how long it\u2019ll take the government to bail it all back out.

In the 2000 years since, structural and stylistic changes to the saddle have seen it evolve to offer support, stability and comfort to both horse and rider. \"As you're galloping down to a meter sixty oxer (a type of jump,) you don't want to be thinking about your saddle,\" American showjumper, Lillie Keenan told CNN. \" And I would say that's the best test for a perfect saddle -- that you're not thinking about it as you're riding.\" JUST WATCHED Horse of a lifetime: Emily Moffitt's Hilfiger\nHorse of a lifetime: Emily Moffitt's Hilfiger 02:19 READ: \"He was a little rascal for sure!\" Read More Keenan is one of the young riders competing in this year's Global Champions League competition, part of the New York Empire team along with top riders like Olympic gold medalist Scott Brash and her trainer, Cian O'Connor. At showjumping's highest level, the saddles used by professionals are carefully fitted to suit each horse and rider. Saddle makers will measure the size and shape of the horse's back, including the length of the spine, width of the withers and their muscle composition. They also consider the unique riding style and comfort preferences of each rider, using an array of gadgets and techniques -- from lasers to impression pads -- all with the goal of achieving the perfect customized fit. Saddles can be customized for the comfort of horse and rider. For Keenan, a comfortable fit means adding knee rolls to support her leg, a slightly deeper seat and the use of a soft, yet durable, leather. \"It's critical that the saddle is really the connect between the horse and rider so that they become one entity, rather than it being the middle part between two individuals,\" she said. Though the options for customizing a saddle can be endless, the basic structure had scarcely changed in the last 100 years -- until recently. JUST WATCHED LGCT Rome: Ben Maher claims the GCT title\nLGCT Rome: Ben Maher claims the GCT title 02:15 READ: Ben Maher roars to LGCT title In 2005, Martin Ryan was finishing up his degree in industrial and product design. As a keen showjumper and eventer, Ryan wondered why the technological advances seen across other sports were lacking in the equestrian disciplines. \"I was satisfied with what I had in terms of saddles, but I knew no better,\" Ryan told CNN. His curiosity and passion for show jumping inspired him to go back to basics, and he spent the next few years researching horse biomechanics while designing and testing materials. And, in 2015, the Bua saddle was launched to market. \"Traditional saddles are great, they're tried and tested through centuries, but a horse moves differently to the rider, and the structure inside a traditional saddle is for the rider, and secondary for the horse,\" \" he said. \"I wanted to balance the needs of the horse and the rider better.\" The foundation of most saddles starts first with a structure called a tree. It acts as the bones of the saddle, balancing the rider and allowing the weight to be evenly distributed across the back of the horse. \"A standard tree conforms to the seat of the rider, and then for it to accommodate to the horse, it has padding attached to the underside,\" Ryan said. \"With the Bua tree, it's in two -- it's a tree for the rider, and a tree for the horse. And it's joined at the front, which means it gives it a natural suspension between the two.\" The cantilevered tree in the Bua saddle is made from a composite material often used in aerospace engineering, making it lightweight yet durable. Traditional materials like leather, then make up the soft components that provide padding and protection. Color combinations like black and brown were introduced for a classical aesthetic. Ryan is the first to call his approach to saddle making somewhat unorthodox. Especially when describing the modular technology that makes the Bua saddle a flexible and interchangeable option that can fit various horses. Since launching, Ryan says that the reviews of the saddle have been surprisingly positive, with their most common criticism being that the aesthetic was too unique -- to put it mildly. \"We had a few comments from people saying it was ugly,\" he said. \"But we do recognize that to make the saddle more mainstream we have to make the appearance a bit more conventional.\" For the company, this means making saddles in colors already recognized and accepted across the sport. Aesthetics aside, the company says it usually only takes one ride to convince the skeptics. \"The first reaction is that they say it feels a bit different but then after five minutes they find they really enjoy it,\" says Ryan, \"and that the horse moves more freely.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/", "https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=sports/2018/09/06/emily-moffitt-hilfiger-horse-of-a-lifetime-lgct-gcl-cnneq-spt-intl.cnn&customer=cnn&edition=international&env=prod", "https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=sports/2018/09/11/rome-longines-global-champions-league-ben-maher-claims-championship-spt-intl.cnn&customer=cnn&edition=international&env=prod"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julius caesar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lillie keenan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily moffitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilfiger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keenan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york empire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-09T01:12:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39c34f8b5b718cb41f1710cf64700cbc9e58b671", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2T9ht_ywizwbG_E8csNiIRz1viHPZWDm5vXAfm5ztaDP97OvquZci_jOdY0hvEusZR44k0y3fgFaEZ9nnqLvkp_7MwgLDfFSp5yVEjvvXjIXqdxL1z0qwHtxSXeKbU4934", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "After Torrid Growth, US Trucking Faces A Sharp Slowdown - The Fringe News", "title_full": "After Torrid Growth, US Trucking Faces A Sharp Slowdown - The Fringe News", "published": "2018-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.119, "main_image": "http://www.thefringenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/www.zerohedge.comtruck1_0_0-f5af206546cff08c41fd17bb71f2ac5cb68393f9.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39c34f8b5b718cb41f1710cf64700cbc9e58b671", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2T9ht_ywizwbG_E8csNiIRz1viHPZWDm5vXAfm5ztaDP97OvquZci_jOdY0hvEusZR44k0y3fgFaEZ9nnqLvkp_7MwgLDfFSp5yVEjvvXjIXqdxL1z0qwHtxSXeKbU4934", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Durden", "published": "2018-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "After Torrid Growth, US Trucking Faces A Sharp Slowdown - The Fringe News", "text": "After Torrid Growth, US Trucking Faces A Sharp Slowdown Posted by Tyler Durden on October 9, 2018 10:50 pmTags: Categories: Economy\nDespite transport stocks recently hitting highs and intermodal shipping attracting more business due to the tight trucking market, experts believe that the recent feverish growth in trucking is now in the rearview mirror.\n\u201cPeak trucking has passed,\u201d stated a recent FreightWaves report. And at a recent Stifel trucking conference, Larry Gross, a principal at Gross Transportation Consulting, went on record saying that North America is past the worst of the trucking shortage and that rates in the industry will start to moderate:\n\u201cGoing forward the industry is in the process of correcting and adding the people and adding drivers. The industry is going to get their driver cohort right sized, which is not to say that it\u2019s going to be easy to recruit drivers, but it won\u2019t continue to be as difficult and and wages will continue to have to go up but not to the extent that we\u2019ve seen recently.\u201d\nAt the same time, truck transportation employment was up for the fifth straight month, as it added 4900 jobs to payrolls in September, accelerating from one year ago today. Rates for trucking peaked at 20% year-over-year growth early this year, but as new drivers join the workforce, and with difficult comparables, these numbers are expected to slow next year.\nGross continued:\n\u201cIn terms of rates, contract rates have been rising quite rapidly this year, but we do expect that rate of increase to drop back down. Not necessarily down to zero, but certainly the rate of increase will up will slow down as we go forward here through 2019 and into 2020.\u201d\nWith trucking rates through the roof, intermodal volumes were at their best levels in four years, according to statistics provided by the Intermodal Association of North America. Year to date revenue for intermodal shipping is up 6.5%, the strongest gain in two years. Big names in the industry are expected to report strong growth this year. Schneider National\u2019s is expected to grow revenue 6.8% and JB Hunt is expected to grow intermodal revenue between 7.5% and 11%.\nBut rates are going to be difficult to sustain going forward, according to Gross.\n\u201cBecause the trucking situation is going to begin to normalize, it\u2019s going to be a much more challenging situation for intermodal. We\u2019re not going to see the kind of large you over year increases in rates that we did in 2018.\u201d\nHelping the industry along has also been the fear of tariffs, which has encouraged front-loaded import demand. This tailwind has seen container volumes coming into North America through August up 5.2% on the year. This \u201ccarryforward\u201d will likely only have a temporary effect, however. Gross continued:\n\u201cThere\u2019s been strong performance for containers, but question is whether that actually reflects freight that was moved earlier than normal, either because of tariffs or fears of congestion or delays at ports.\u201d\nAs this slowdown in the industry looms, transportation stock indicators are all near, or at, record highs, with the Dow Jones Transportation average and the S&P 500 transportation index both near all time highs. Yet while rail companies have showed continued strength this year, with the S&P 1500 rail index up as much as 23% in January, the S&P 1500 trucking index was down almost 13% as the market sniffs out the inflection point.\nWhy the divergence between trains and trucking? Yardeni Research\u2019s Ed Yardeni said that he believes the differentiation was due to higher labor costs and fuel prices having a more profound effect on trucking versus rail . He also believes that the gap between rail and trucking could continue until either automation or a recession comes along.\n\u201cI am fairly certain we saw movement of cargo early as August is the peak for volume, but July was higher than August,\u201d Larry Gross concluded. \u201cThe rest of 2018 may see see more restrained growth because of the early cargo movement.\u201d The final outcome may be far worse should trade war between China and the US escalate further, crippling trans-Pacific trade and resulting in much lower trade volumes just as the rush to get ahead of tariffs finally fades.\nThe article, \"After Torrid Growth, US Trucking Faces A Sharp Slowdown\", was syndicated from and first appeared at: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/poXvMKAvbDk/after-torrid-growth-us-trucking-faces-sharp-slowdown.\nYou may find more great articles by Tyler Durden on http://www.zerohedge.com/fullrss2.xml/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/CBO%20August%201.png/%2A%7CFORWARD%7C%2A.

The storm is now moving into extreme southeastern Alabama and southwest Georgia, bringing life-threatening storm surge and catastrophic winds. Live updates on Hurricane Michael Michael was downgraded to Category 3 storm at 5 p.m. Wednesday, which means it is still considered a major storm. Maximum sustained winds up to 125 mph posed concerns over downed trees in densely wooded areas inland such as Tallahassee. Got my power lines.

Water seeped into her fourth floor apartment When she dared to look outside, water levels were grazing the fronds of tall palm trees on the beach. Homes were swallowed in storm surge. Soon enough, Mexico Beach's emerald waters and white sugar-sand beaches were covered in a dark sea of splintered debris, she said. \"This is total devastation,\" she told CNN. \"We didn't think it was going to be this bad.\" After making landfall near Mexico Beach around 2 p.m. ET, the eye of Michael moved inland over the Florida Panhandle east of Panama City. Wind gusts blew out windows in homes and office buildings, including the First Federal Bank and Medical Sacred Heart. The hospital said it is running off of generators and patients have been moved to safe areas of the facility.\nView this post on Instagram You can see straight through the big first federal bank on 23rd start\nA post shared by Garrett Bolduc (@garrettdotb) on Oct 10, 2018 at 2:02pm PDT\nAs winds subsided in Panama City, resident Reid Garrett said his concerns shifted to flooding outside his apartment complex, which surrounded by downed trees. Across the bay in Panama City Beach, a resort city on the Gulf of Mexico known for its white-sand beach and amusement parks, winds of about 100 mph furiously whipped the trees in the early afternoon and pulled apart homes.

MUST WATCH\nHurricane wind tears roof off home 01:54 Rain just one of several threats A hurricane warning remains in place from the Alabama-Florida border to the Suwannee River in Florida. Meanwhile, tropical storm warnings were in effect for parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Storm surge warnings were in place along the Florida and Alabama coasts. Why Hurricane Michael is a monster unlike any other Up to 12 inches of rain could fall in Florida's Panhandle and Big Bend areas, as well as southeastern Alabama and southern Georgia. Some parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia, recently deluged by Hurricane Florence , could see up to 6 inches, the hurricane center said. Michael's rain and destructive winds aren't its only serious threats. Life-threatening storm surges could slam the Florida Gulf Coast, with the deadliest of possibly 9 to 14 feet expected near the eyewall and to the east -- perhaps between Tyndall Air Force Base and the Aucilla River. Effect of climate change Michael's strength may reflect the effect of climate change on storms. The planet has warmed significantly over the past several decades, causing changes in the environment.\nView this post on Instagram This will probably be the last time I do this for a long time!!!!

There's evidence of higher sea surface temperature and atmospheric moisture, experts say. While we might not get more storms in a warmer climate, most studies show storms will get stronger and produce more rain. Storm surge is worse now than it was 100 years ago, thanks to the rise in sea levels. Here's why Hurricane Michael's storm surge will likely be disastrous According to Climate Central, a scientific research organization, the coming decades are expected to bring hurricanes that intensify more rapidly, should there be no change in the rate of greenhouse gas emissions.

The soda brand announced new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Cinnamon on October 3 and called it \u201ca drink full of festive flavour and no sugar, perfect for the lead-up to Christmas.\u201d Though the secret recipe for Coca-Cola probably already contains cinnamon, this new iteration of the classic soda turns up the heat and lets the festive taste and aroma of cinnamon take center stage. Coca-Cola explained that the new spice-flavored drink was \u201claunched in response to consumers\u2019 love of [cinnamon]\u201d and described the soda as \u201cbursting with warming flavours.\u201d The reaction to the release was a mixed bag, with many wanting to try it for themselves. This isn\u2019t the first quirky offering that the soda giant has launched this year US customers were treated to the arrival of four new Diet Coke flavors in January: feisty cherry, twisted mango, zesty blood orange, and ginger lime. February also saw the launch of Georgia Peach and California Raspberry Coca-Cola, which the company called a return to its \u201cartisanal roots.\u201d These locally-inspired flavors were meant to harken back to the days when soda was mixed by hand at drugstores. \u201cSoda shops would experiment with different flavors,\u201d explained Ted Ryan, Coca-Cola archivist, in a press release. \u201cVanilla and Cherry were favorites, of course, but you\u2019d also find locally sourced flavors on tap in different parts of the country. Peach was popular in the South and, believe it or not, maple syrup was common up north.\u201d The new cinnamon flavor will only be added to the Coca-Cola Zero Sugar line The flavor is currently not available in the US, but US patrons can still enjoy classic Coca-Cola. AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee\nUnfortunately for Coca-Cola devotees living stateside, there\u2019s no word on when or if this new flavor will be available in the US.

Follow @cnnsport But victories for Hamilton in back-to-back grands prix in Italy and Singapore -- a combination of sublime driving and Ferrari errors -- helped the Briton take a firm grip on a fifth world title.

Should Hamilton win in Austin, Texas to secure a seventh win in eight races, Vettel would need to finish second to ensure the title race goes on for another week. \"It's like it's a marathon, not a sprint,\" Hamilton told reporters Sunday. \"I did long-distance running when I was a kid, cross country, and you just run out of stamina to keep hold with those who, for whatever reason, had the stamina at the time. \"We seem to have the stamina this year.\" 'Gift-wrapped' Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents Fernando Alonso's spectacular crash at Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix reignited the debate around driver safety, specifically the new \"halo.\" Built around the cockpit to protect drivers from debris, it appeared to come to the rescue of Charles Leclerc as Alonso's airborne car bounced off it and over him. Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents It was the second serious incident Alonso has been involved in in as many years, although his crash at the 2016 was arguably worse. After colliding with Esteban Gutierrez, Alonso's car hit the wall at 200mph, flipping through the air before coming to rest upside down. \"I'm lucky to be here and thankful to be here,\" Alonso said after the crash.

A three-time world champion, the Brazilian is still regarded as one of the greatest drivers ever. Senna's death resulted in widespread changes, including limiting engine size and power and raised cockpits sides to offer drivers more protection. Suspension also changed to prevent wheels from becoming disconnected from the front wing. Hide Caption 3 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents Jules Bianchi, Suzuka 2014 \u2013 Jules Bianchi's death in 2015 -- nine months after his crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix -- was the first in Formula One since Senna's. On a sodden Suzuka track, Bianchi lost control of his car and smashed into a recovery vehicle dealing with an earlier crash involving driver Adrian Sutil. As a result of the incident, F1 changed regulations for drainage on tracks and how vehicles would respond to crashes.

The incident took place at a point on the 22.8 km circuit that was almost impossible to access and Lauda had to be pulled from the wreckage by four fellow drivers. After the crash, the N\u00fcrburgring was removed from the F1 calendar for the following season.

In yet another Spa deluge and with the drivers barely visible on TV through the rain, 13 drivers spun out in the opening seconds. The race restarted more than an hour later and featured 18 of the 22 drivers as teams were then allowed spare cars, a rule that has since been abolished. Hide Caption 6 of 6 But while Mercedes has been a well-oiled machine this season, several costly errors from Ferrari and Vettel have allowed their rivals to build a near-unassailable lead. Some of the criticism has been scathing, with British F1 journalist Jonathan McEvoy saying the Italian manufacturers \"practically gift-wrapped the world title\" for Hamilton. YES!! What a race! I love this track, it's crazy fun out there, I had the biggest smile on my face. To the team, I am proud of everything you do, I love you guys. #TeamLH , I am moved by your unwavering support.

The pair collided, leaving Vettel to spin out and end up at the back of the pack. He recovered well but could only claw his way back to eighth. Hamilton points to the close-fought race in Monza, when he battled with Vettel's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and eventually passed him with nine laps to go to clinch victory. \"Honestly, I thought that was how it was going to be, being as they were so strong in the previous two races. But they've lost a lot of performance and it has been a little bit difficult for them,\" he said. \"Of course, I would love to have a race right to the end. Every single race I want battles like Monza. Those are the races that I love. But we can't let it take away from the great job that we're doing and our happiness.\" Such is Mercedes' dominance in recent times, the German manufacturer is on the verge of winning a fifth consecutive drivers'-constructors' championship double and equaling Ferrari's and Michael Schumacher's record from 2000-2004. The question is now rightly being asked as to whether Hamilton will one day equal Schumacher's all-time record of seven world titles. The Brit already holds the record of 80 pole positions, in just 225 races, compared to Schumacher's 68 in 307 and is just 24 podium places behind the German legend's record total of 155. But despite Hamilton and Mercedes boasting a comfortable lead in both heading to the US, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff is taking nothing for granted. \"This is a tough fight and nobody is prepared to give an inch, not us, not our competitors,\" he told the Guardian before the weekend's race. \"It's five races to go, lots of points to score and that is why you cannot take your foot off the pedal. \"We must be relentless and resilient. I always fear losing the world championship, even now because this is motor racing and things can change pretty quickly. \"Every time when we become a little too optimistic I remind myself of the championship Lewis lost by one point in 2007. He was in the lead by what would be today 45 points with two races to go. \"So the thought of the possibility of losing is omnipresent.\" 'Psychological battle' JUST WATCHED Valtteri Bottas: Finland's Formula One hero Replay More Videos ...

So that's the goal and also, from past experiences, so much can happen.\" Wolff describes Hamilton as \"a complex individual, multi-faceted\" and praises his positive attitude in the face of adversity, something Ferrari haven't dealt with quite as well this season. \"Together we can claim credit for applying the pressure and, ultimately, maybe that is what happens in head-to-head battles with top competitors,\" Hamilton said of his opponent's capitulation. \"Even though they are still performing great, one of them can't always perform the same. It is a psychological battle, war, we are in. \"It's collectively. Everyone has putting 100 per cent in and everyone has delivered time and time again.

Our vision of catching tuna that would provide at least four meals of sushi and seared steaks would be a reality if we could actually catch one.

Jonathan steers the dinghy back to the boat after a shopping trip to Levanzo in Sicily's Egadi Islands. There was just one small grocery store on this island and it had sold out of fresh milk and bread. For a start, unless we are moored in a marina, we have to go ashore in a dinghy. This requires a 15-step process and a mountain of patience to attach an outboard motor that constantly threatens to run out of fuel. Once we've made it onto dry land without having to bring out the oars, the next challenge is finding a supermarket or any place we can stock up on supplies. Baguettes become fish food We never know what we are going to find from one destination to the next and often the price of anchoring in secluded and pristine waters is a long trek to and from civilization weighted down by backpacks full of fresh and preserved produce. READ: Sailing the world with a baby We've also found that we can't always buy fresh milk, bread and other staples like we did back home in England, so we have had to become strategic when provisioning for the boat. It's a matter of calculating how much we can carry, how much we can actually store on the boat and how many days we need to sustain ourselves in between dinghy trips. Sometimes the market comes to you. Fresh fruit and vegetables sold off a cart in Cefalu Sicily. We've also learned to factor in potential mishaps. Many baguettes have arrived back on the boat sodden because they're not easy to fit into waterproof backpacks. Many have become fish food, dropped during the unglamorous maneuver of disembarking from dinghy to boat. Needless to say, packaged fajita wraps are a standard purchase in lieu of lost or salted bread. He didn't have to throw the pasta against the wall to test that it was al dente.

This was quite a challenge for a couple still learning to stay upright in rolling seas, let alone cook in a 2x2 meter galley kitchen with two gas burners and an oven that apparently only delivers pizzas with a burnt base and raw toppings.

Chief Evans said.\nShields currently serves in the National Guard and was in the Army for 22 years. He doesn\u2019t have much interest in the praise he\u2019s received from a town thankful that he saved lives.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a hero just taking it in,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI was just trying to diffuse the problem.\u201d\n\u201cHe downplayed a hero but he\u2019s a hero,\u201d Asst. Chief Evans said. \u201cHe needs to be praised and we\u2019ll praise him and if he don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nPolice said the shooter opened fire after a fight. That shooter's identity has not been released because he is a minor.\nThe juvenile shooter was in court Monday, Oct. 8, which was reset until next Monday, Oct. 15.\nPolice are asking the District Attorney to try him as an adult.\nCopyright 2018 WMC.
