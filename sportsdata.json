Kamara\u2019s statement follows Eric Reid \u2019s\nIt comes on the same week that Eric Reid returned to the NFL with the Carolina Panthers and took a knee during the anthem. Reid was a teammate of Kaepernick\u2019s in San Francisco and the first player to join his quarterback in kneeling during the anthem.\nA 26-year-old safety who started 69 of his 70 career games with the 49ers, Reid had trouble finding a job in the wake of the anthem controversy.

(photo via Cliff and Amy Brees)\nThe man who\u2019s poised to break the NFL\u2019s all-time passing record Monday night wasn\u2019t always on a path to superstardom.\nA quarter century ago, Drew Brees wasn\u2019t even the top quarterback in his high school class.\nCoaches at Texas football powerhouse Westlake High School anointed Jonny Rodgers as quarterback of their freshman A team in 1993 and began grooming him to take over as the varsity starter two years later. Relegated to quarterbacking the B team was Brees, then a scrawny private school transfer who had never played tackle football before.\nWhile Brees already had a slightly more powerful, accurate arm than Rodgers by that point, he was not as good a fit for the option-style attack Westlake favored at that time. Not only was he wholly unfamiliar with the system, he also lacked the elusiveness to evade defenders in the open field or the muscle to withstand big hits.\nThe son of a University of Texas assistant coach and younger brother of Westlake\u2019s varsity starting quarterback at the time, Rodgers boasted the requisite strength, speed and agility for a dual-threat quarterback. He also was already comfortable with the system, having run it while quarterbacking one of the middle schools that feeds into Westlake.\n\u201cI thought I was going to be the guy,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cMy brother Jay was going to be a senior when Drew and I were going to be sophomores, and it was kind of set up for me to take over the following year. There was no indication in my eyes that there was someone who was going to take my spot, especially not someone in our class.\u201d\nRodgers was so entrenched as Westlake\u2019s heir apparent at quarterback that Brees briefly pondered giving up football early in his sophomore year. One hot August day, a frustrated Brees came home from two-a-day practice and told his mother he wanted to concentrate solely on baseball, but she urged him to be patient and forbade him from quitting in the middle of the season. Story Continues\nEverything changed for Rodgers and Brees only days later during Westlake\u2019s final preseason junior varsity scrimmage against Killeen High School. As Rodgers rolled right and planted to throw, his knee buckled and his football future flickered.\nSuddenly Rodgers was facing nine months of grueling rehab and the possibility that he had squandered his chance to follow his older brother as Westlake\u2019s next standout quarterback. Suddenly Brees was Westlake\u2019s JV starter, the break he needed to prove himself to a coaching staff that until that point had been reluctant to give him a real chance.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say what would have happened if Jonny hadn\u2019t torn his ACL,\u201d former Westlake football coach Ron Schroeder said. \u201cIf Jonny had been healthy his entire sophomore year, that would have kept Drew on the B team in all probability because Jonny was good enough not to be benched. We could very well have stuck with Jonny Rodgers at quarterback, and you probably wouldn\u2019t know who Drew Brees is.\u201d Jonny Rodgers (left) Drew Brees (middle) and teammate Jamie Tyler (right) were three of the key players on Westlake\u2019s 1996 state championship team. (photo via Jonny Rodgers) It took awhile for Brees to match his genetic destiny\nSchroeder might have given Brees a chance more quickly if someone had made him aware of the young quarterback\u2019s impressive bloodlines.\nBrees\u2019 father is Eugene \u201cChip\u201d Brees, who played basketball at Texas A&M. His late mother is Mina Akins, a four-sport athlete and all-state basketball player at Gregory Portland High School. His maternal grandfather is Ray Akins, one of the winningest coaches in Texas high school football history. And his uncle is Marty Akins, a wishbone-style quarterback at Texas who started for two years in the same backfield as Earl Campbell.\nBlessed with enviable genes, an insatiable competitive spirit and parents who encouraged him to dabble in numerous sports, Brees excelled at nearly everything he tried as a kid.\nHe starred for a prestigious youth soccer club in elementary school until the schedule became too demanding for him and his parents. He hit third in the batting order for all his youth baseball teams and often dominated from the pitcher\u2019s mound as well. He was once the state of Texas\u2019 top-ranked youth tennis player, just ahead of future U.S. Open champ and World No. 1 Andy Roddick.\nYes @drewbrees beat me in tennis when I was 9 and he was 11. Twice\u2026. I finally beat him and he quit tennis. You're welcome football\n\u2014 andyroddick (@andyroddick) January 11, 2014\n\u201cHe was always the kid growing up who could pick up a golf club, a ping pong paddle, a tennis racket, a baseball, a football, and it was like he had been doing it for years,\u201d childhood friend Ryan Riviere said. \u201cFrom the first time I met him in Little League, it was apparent he was the best player on our team, and it wasn\u2019t even close.\u201d\nFootball was the one sport Brees had yet to conquer before he got to Westlake. He had started at quarterback for his private middle school\u2019s flag football team, but that didn\u2019t remotely prepare him for a role on one of the top high school teams in Texas\u2019 highest-enrollment division.\nWhen Westlake held its first intrasquad scrimmage prior to Brees\u2019 freshman season, he didn\u2019t play a single snap. He had never lifted weights before. He had not yet physically matured. And while he offered occasional glimpses of uncanny accuracy as a passer, he required a long, looping wind-up to zip passes into tight windows because his arm strength was not yet up to par.\n\u201cAt that time, he didn\u2019t really stand out,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cHe was just a young kid who was still growing. He wasn\u2019t very strong. He wasn\u2019t very fast. But he was working hard.\u201d\nBy the time Rodgers\u2019 knee injury forced the Westlake coaches to find someone else to serve as JV starting quarterback, Brees had begun to close the gap between himself and his classmate. He still wasn\u2019t physically imposing, but he now displayed newfound familiarity with Westlake\u2019s system and a knack beyond his years for recognizing blitzes, reading coverage schemes and finding open receivers.\nBrees threw for 300 yards and four touchdowns in his first start and quarterbacked Westlake\u2019s JV team to a perfect 10-0 record during the 1994 season. Schroeder didn\u2019t formally name Brees the 1995 varsity starter until the following spring, but Rodgers was shrewd enough to recognize long before then that he\u2019d lost his grip on the job.\n\u201cDrew came in and just ignited our offense,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cAs soon as I saw how well he was playing, I knew pretty quickly the only way I\u2019d ever see the field was to learn the defensive side of the ball.\u201d Drew Brees (No. 15) threw for more than 5,000 yards and led Westlake to a 28-0-1 record in two seasons as the varsity starting quarterback. (photo via Chip and Amy Brees) How Drew Brees seized control of a team\nAs Rodgers transitioned to free safety and became a leader on the Westlake defense, Brees quickly demonstrated he\u2019d have no problem making the leap from JV to varsity quarterback. He amassed a 28-0-1 record in two seasons as the varsity starter and threw for more than 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns, displaying improved throwing mechanics on the practice field, command of the offense in the pocket and leadership beyond his years in the huddle.\nA Westlake team loaded with senior starters ripped through its regular-season schedule without a loss during Brees\u2019 junior year before disaster struck in the third round of the state playoffs. This time it was Brees who tore an ACL when he planted wrong trying to steady himself after a blitzer blindsided him on a naked bootleg.\nExpectations were more modest for Westlake the following season with Brees only nine months removed from knee surgery and most of the previous year\u2019s starters lost to graduation. All Brees did was come back with newfound resolve, win the Texas 5A offensive player of the year award and lead Westlake to its lone state championship in program history.\nNo one was a bigger supporter of Brees during that time period than Rodgers, a testament to the character they both possess. The former competitors grew to be such close friends that Rodgers actually led a \u201cDrew Brees\u201d chant in the huddle after one particularly memorable playoff win at the Alamodome.\n\u201cBrees was so good, so humble and so likable that Jonny couldn\u2019t help but to become a fan,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any doubt in anyone\u2019s mind during their senior year that Drew was the quarterback. I think Jonny saw that and I also think Jonny enjoyed playing free safety and becoming a leader on defense too.\u201d\nThe offensive player of the year in Texas\u2019 highest-enrollment division typically has his pick of colleges, but that was not the case for Brees. Remarkably, not a single Division I college had offered Brees a scholarship by the end of his sterling senior season.\nSince Brees\u2019 ill-timed knee injury prevented him from participating in any camps and recruiting combines the summer before his senior year, many college coaches either missed the chance to get to know him on a personal level or were unfamiliar with him altogether. Those that were aware of Brees were hesitant to commit to a quarterback who stood barely 6 feet tall in cleats and possessed only average speed.\n\u201cWe were hopeful there would be some interest in Drew in the offseason after his junior year and then the knee injury occurred,\u201d said Chip Brees, Drew\u2019s father. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get scholarship offers, phone calls, letters, nothing. Whatever interest there had been in Drew before that point was derailed.\u201d\nEspecially harmful to Brees was disinterest from the University of Texas, a program whose campus was a 15-minute drive from Westlake\u2019s and whose recruiting coordinator was Rodgers\u2019 father. The Longhorns pursued quarterback prospects Major Applewhite and Marty Cherry instead of Brees, a snub that no doubt fueled the doubts of other top programs in Texas and beyond.\nTexas A&M was Brees\u2019 childhood favorite school and the alma mater of his mother and father, yet the Aggies chased other quarterbacks. Baylor, SMU and Texas Tech each received calls on Brees\u2019 behalf from his coaches or family members, but they too declined to pursue him. Chip even paid for he and his son to visit North Carolina, Duke and Virginia out of his own pocket while Brees was still rehabbing his knee injury, but coaches from those schools had no interest in meeting with the future NFL quarterback while he was on their campuses.\n\u201cWe heard back from someone on Mack Brown\u2019s staff [at North Carolina] saying basically thanks but no thanks,\u201d Chip Brees recalled. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re welcome to come visit the university, but we don\u2019t have time to visit with you.\u2019\n\u201cIt just seems logical to me that if the college program in your backyard is not recruiting you, other programs are going to think, \u2018What do they know that we don\u2019t? They see the kid every week. They must know more than everybody else. Maybe there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re not recruiting him.\u2019\u201d Drew Brees (9) also starred on the Westlake baseball team. His coaches believed he\u2019d have been a pro prospect in that sport too had he focused on it. (photo via Chip and Amy Brees) Enduring friendship for Rodgers, Brees\nBrees might have quarterbacked an Ivy League school or pursued a baseball scholarship had a pair of pass-happy football coaches not become enamored with him in the nick of time. Purdue\u2019s Joe Tiller and Kentucky\u2019s Hal Mumme both had scholarships available late and came to view Brees as their quarterback of the future after watching him spearhead Westlake\u2019s spectacular run through the Texas state playoffs.\nPurdue won a brief battle to land Brees because of the strength of its academics, the prestige of the Big Ten and the possibility of early playing time. Kentucky\u2019s pitch to Brees was to redshirt and sit behind Tim Couch for another year before potentially winning the starting job in Year 3.\nIn many ways, landing at Purdue instead of Texas or Texas A&M may have been a blessing in disguise for Brees. It gave Brees the chance to earn playing time quickly and showcase himself to NFL scouts in a pass-oriented offense tailored to his strengths.\nAs Brees prepared to begin his college football career at Purdue, Rodgers was coming to grips with hanging up his cleats for the final time. He had suffered a second torn ACL in the waning minutes of the state championship game, shuttling his plans to play quarterback at TCU as a preferred walk-on.\n\u201cI thank God everyday that I blew my knee out a second time because it forced me to realize it was time to do something else,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI went to TCU, had a great time, came back to Austin, got into real estate and I\u2019m enjoying life here.\u201d\nTwenty-one years after they graduated high school, Brees and Rodgers remain close friends. They contribute to one-another\u2019s charitable causes and talk or text regularly, the subject usually former classmates and funny memories rather than anything to do with pro football.\nBecause it was Rodgers\u2019 fateful knee injury that opened the door for Brees to launch his football career, the two men will be forever tied.\nWere it not for Rodgers\u2019 misfortune, who knows if Brees would be entering Monday night\u2019s game 201 yards away from breaking Peyton Manning\u2019s all-time NFL passing yardage record? Maybe Brees wouldn\u2019t have played football beyond high school at all.\nThe link with Brees is something Rodgers\u2019 friends tease him about all the time. Instead of introducing him to strangers as a successful real-estate agent, a generous philanthropist or the city of Austin\u2019s 2015 man of the year, Rodgers\u2019 oldest friends often prefer to highlight that he once started ahead of one of the NFL\u2019s premier quarterbacks.\n\u201cLooking back, it is a lot easier to say that I got beat out by Drew Brees rather than some random guy,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI like to think it was God\u2019s plan. We\u2019re going to move you aside. We\u2019ve got some other cool things for you in the future outside of football, but right now we need to put everything on this Drew Brees kid because he is special.\u201d Drew Brees (middle) and Jonny Rodgers (right) remain close friends more than two decades after their competition to become Westlake\u2019s starting quarterback.

Brooke is at the age where being a girl on the gridiron starts to become a \u201cthing.\u201d In this instance, it\u2019s an issue for the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which reversed a short-lived policy in 2014 that allowed for co-ed CYO football teams.\nIn doing so, the archdiocese is back in the spotlight for again denying a talented, passionate player a chance to play in its organization as profiled Monday by Brian Hickey of PhillyVoice . Archdiocese fears \u2018inappropriate touching\u2019 could take place\nSuzanne Choi attempted to sign her daughter up for the four-parish-wide Chester County Crusaders team the first week of August, but was cut short at the gender portion.\nIn a statement by Crusaders board president Edward Caporellie to the PhillyVoice, the Chois were told girls can\u2019t register for tackle football by archdiocesan rule and that neither the team nor the district could overturn that decision.\nGuy Fardone is the Crusaders coach and said he wants to see girls play football, specifically Brooke because of her talent and passion. He said he supports the family, adding they \u201cstill don\u2019t know why\u201d she can\u2019t play, and made her an honorary captain for the season opener .\n\u201cWhen I was first helping Brooke try to play, they said she couldn\u2019t because she could get hurt. I\u2019d be more concerned about a 65-pound-boy getting hurt. Brooke was one of the more aggressive players on the team,\u201d he told Philly Voice. \u201cThen, they came back with the \u2018inappropriate touching\u2019 statement.\u201d Story Continues\nAs Suzanne continued to ask questions up the ladder, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia said girls could not play because they feared \u201cinappropriate touching\u201d could take place.\nThat\u2019s what has received the most frustration with Suzanne, who noted her daughter has never had that happen and there aren\u2019t locker rooms at that level, and seemingly the most anger from others watching. Are there others supporting her quest to play?\nMickey Grace was the first girl to carry the ball in a Philadelphia Public League football game in the late 2000s and interned with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this past preseason. Her comments to the Philly Voice put the issue into context with current events.\nShe saw the prohibition through a different lens, noting that the Archdiocese should be \u201cadamant about making sure they raise integrity-filled people and men\u201d instead of barring girls from the sport.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the social role of football: Teaching discipline. Being self-motivated and team-oriented,\u201d said Grace, who faced a lot more pushback when she played than Brooke has faced. \u201cThey\u2019re robbing her of that opportunity because they\u2019re worried someone else will not have any integrity.\nBrooke has the support of the Crusaders coach as well as former coach Tom Kucera, who gave full confidence she could \u201cdefend herself\u201d in a league that he said was a few notches below the one she played in formerly. Grace, of course, supports her as does Caroline Pla, the only girl to play in the CYO.\nShe played in sixth, seventh and eighth grade before the Archdiocese reversed its co-ed ruling. How does Title IX play into this?\nTitle IX states that no person shall be excluded on the basis of sex and applies to institutions that receive federal funding. In terms of athletics, it outlines a three-part test that requires schools to follow any of the three options:\nProvide opportunities proportionate to enrollment numbers\nDemonstrate a continued expansion of opportunities for the underrepresented sex\nAccommodate interests and abilities of underrepresented sex\nSuzanne was told the law would be on their side because the archdiocese accepts federal money for its lunch programs. Plus there is precedent in the Mercer vs. Duke University case, which barred places from making an exemption if it hadn\u2019t before.\nIn this case, Pla was allowed to play. So the argument is why is Choi (and Pla as an eighth-grader) is suddenly not allowed? More girls are taking the field around the country\nPeople love to comment on the decline of football participation. Kids leave the sport for varied reasons, from concussion concerns to sport specialization to increased offerings during the autumn season.\nWhile Brooke\u2019s issue is at the youth level, the statistics at the high school level are telling. While less boys are playing 11-player football year-after-year, the number of girls has nearly doubled . And while that number doesn\u2019t come close to making up for the number of boys who have left, it helps keep the decrease percentage lower .\nMost importantly it shows girls want to play this sport and are increasingly receiving the support and opportunities they deserve to have.\nMore from Yahoo Sports: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brooke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooke choi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian hickey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archdi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillyvoice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic youth organization", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-09T11:51:55.095+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "844770fce06b0865a0e1017c4e91f06fa219d4ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WuSX5Bnq3Z.YrTZKptzqQiJX4X.hH72iFNCv7lj2Zp7hkUr4jVFwLTCAcHHU3ROWppuHtibe21amMpLCTX_azLbJ0LlP.17yAci3eKbPwmII-", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "UFC 229: Khabib Nurmagomedov will face his father's punishment", "title_full": "UFC 229: Khabib Nurmagomedov will face his father's punishment", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0gL2CsbcxypTspGWccUWng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NjEuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1CHUnRinWGW7yhBLRaJgEA--~B/aD0yODAxO3c9NDE1OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/acc50652144d7dce85d843f1dd119618", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 492, "comments": 265, "shares": 367}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "844770fce06b0865a0e1017c4e91f06fa219d4ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WuSX5Bnq3Z.YrTZKptzqQiJX4X.hH72iFNCv7lj2Zp7hkUr4jVFwLTCAcHHU3ROWppuHtibe21amMpLCTX_azLbJ0LlP.17yAci3eKbPwmII-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Torrey Hartyahoo Sportsoctober", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "UFC 229: Khabib Nurmagomedov will face his father's punishment", "text": "Yahoo Sports 8 October 2018, 18:35 GMT\nKhabib Nurmagomedov has yet to be paid following his lightweight title win over Conor McGregor at UFC 229 that ended in chaos, but that penalty might be the least of his worries.\nThe 30-year-old\u2019s father has promised to punish him, condemning his son\u2019s role in sparking a massive post-match brawl .\n\u201cI will be very hard on this.

(Getty)\nA civil lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade County, Florida, charges that Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown threw several objects from a high condominium balcony, very nearly hitting a man and his 22-month-old grandson. The suit, Ophir Sternberg et. al. v. Antonio Brown , first reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , seeks $15,000 in damages for emotional distress. Lawsuit\u2019s allegations about Brown\u2019s conduct\nAccording to the suit, Sternberg and his grandson were walking near the pool at The Mansions at Acqualina in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, when objects began falling from a balcony high above. \u201cThe falling objects included two very large vases, estimated to be over three feet each, as well as a large, heavy ottoman and other pieces of furniture,\u201d according to the suit.\nSternberg charged that the objects fell within a foot or two of himself and his grandson, and could have caused severe injury or death. Security personnel determined that the objects were thrown by Brown from the 14th floor, and security video apparently exists; the lawsuit does not indicate whether Brown appears on the video.\nThe lawsuit notes that Sunny Isles police arrived on the scene to find Brown \u201cextremely agitated, acting aggressively, and yelling at security personnel.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Brown\u2019s conduct was outrageous, goes beyond the bounds of decency, and is regarded as odious and utterly intolerable in civilized community,\u201d the lawsuit adds. Second lawsuit filed over incident\nThe Post-Gazette noted that neither Brown\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, nor the Steelers had a comment on the lawsuit. KDKA-TV reported that a second lawsuit has been filed over the incident by the unit\u2019s landlord , charging that Brown damaged the unit and has not paid for damages.\nBrown has until Thursday to respond to Sternberg\u2019s lawsuit after filing for an extension in September.

Brees hit rookie Tre\u2019Quan Smith for a 62-yard touchdown, passing Peyton Manning for the most passing yards in NFL history . Brees\u2019 teammates came out to celebrate the moment with their leader.\nAnd, of course, the NFL\u2019s officials couldn\u2019t just let the moment happen. There was a 15-yard penalty thrown on the play. ESPN\u2019s Kevin Seifert said it was for taunting in the end zone . The NFL\u2019s play-by-play account said the unsportsmanlike conduct foul was on receiver Michael Thomas. A flag for taunting after Drew Brees\u2019 record pass\nNobody could have possibly been upset at the scene in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, not even the Washington Redskins defenders who gave up the record pass.\nBrees is universally respected around the league. He is a great competitor and has done remarkable charity work in New Orleans. He also came from a humble background, at least for a sure-fire first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback. He overcame a lot of odds to become the NFL\u2019s all-time leading passer.\nThrowing a penalty flag for taunting on Brees\u2019 big touchdown is like giving a speeding ticket to someone driving 36 miles per hour in a 35-mph zone. You have to let some things slide in certain moments. The penalty was assessed on the following kickoff. New Orleans loved the moment\nIn reality, the flag was an annoyance to a great moment. Saints fans soaked in the moment, as they should. Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker got on some white gloves to take the record ball, which he\u2019ll bring to Canton. Brees hugged his family and, thanks to him being mic\u2019ed up for the game, we heard him give a pep talk to his young sons about being able to accomplish anything if they worked for it. Story Continues\nStill, the NFL didn\u2019t really have to throw the flag. But, the NFL usually finds a reason to throw too many penalty flags, even during a great moment. New Orleans Saints players surround quarterback Drew Brees after Brees broke the NFL all-time passing yardage record.

And it went about as well as you\u2019d imagine it going.\nAll-Star Jimmy Butler participated in Minnesota's practice, a session that included him verbally challenging teammates, coaches and front office, league sources told ESPN. Butler was vociferous and emotional at times, targeting Thibodeau/Layden/Towns/Wiggins. Story soon on ESPN.\n\u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) October 10, 2018\nThat sounds bonkers, but there were even more details.\nAt one point in a scrimmage, sources said, Butler turned to GM Scott Layden and screamed, \"You (bleeping) need me. You can't win without me.\" Butler left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the gym in every way. Jimmy's back.\nWoj clarified what Butler said in his ESPN story:\n\u201cYou f\u2014ing need me.

You can\u2019t win without me\u201d at practice?\nJimmy may be back, but who knows for how long it\u2019ll be with the Timberwolves. He very clearly doesn\u2019t want to play for them (despite reportedly shouting \u201cyou f\u2014ing need me\u201d during Wednesday\u2019s practice), but Minnesota hasn\u2019t been able to get any offers that equal what they gave up for Butler last year. It\u2019s an uncomfortable situation at best. But considering how Butler handled practice with his current team, he\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it at all.

He\u2019s already served six and a half months in prison previously and could return on the charges filed in Union County, New Jersey.\nHe faces 3 to 5 years on each charge. Lenny Dykstra was indicted on charges from an incident with an Uber driver in New Jersey in May. Why happened with Dykstra and the Uber driver?\nDykstra was arrested in May after allegedly threatening an Uber driver with a gun. According to the police report, Dykstra requested an early morning Uber ride from Linden, New Jersey, and once in the car he changed his destination to Staten Island.\nThe driver said Dykstra would have to change it in the app in order to be driven there, and the former major leaguer reportedly got hostile.\n\u201cDykstra then placed a black pill bag with an object [the driver] believed to be a gun to his head and said \u2018take me to Staten Island or I\u2019ll blow your (expletive) head off,\u201d according to the police report.\nThe driver drove Dykstra to the Linden Police station and ran screaming for help. Dykstra told officers he was kidnapped and allowed police to search him. Though he recanted his permission, police determined probable cause and found what they believe to be marijuana, a glass pipe, a straw with suspected cocaine residue, a vial of suspected cocaine and two pills thought to be MDMA. What is Dykstra\u2019s side of the story?\nDykstra has denied the driver\u2019s side of the story from the beginning, including in police body cam video obtained by TMZ. He told the police the driver was going to kill him, that the driver drove 100 mph to get to the station, and said multiple times he didn\u2019t have a firearm. Story Continues\nDykstra held a news conference with his attorneys after the arrest to tell his story, claiming the driver kidnapped him . He filed a countersuit against the driver.\nHis camp seems to still be sticking to this side of the events, enough so that Dykstra\u2019s attorney, Matthew Blit, told this to TMZ Sports:\n\u201cA grand jury will indict a ham sandwich. The evidence in this case overwhelmingly confirms Lenny is innocent.\u201d Has Dykstra been in trouble before?\nOh, yes. The 55-year-old served time for grand theft auto and filing a false financial statement. He\u2019s declared bankruptcy, attended rehab, admitted to steroids and written a book.\nMore from Yahoo Sports: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lenny dykstra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dykstra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "philadelphia phillies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york mets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "staten island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T09:23:33.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d770e94ae11a7759c029803b0e4b46d0eb20b6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W.59gPIh5_5EwOBs.zwZ8d68uQqrK4jVzWl6uQHh2Wmgp7kRJSioZy0XPHMKNOluu", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Report: NFL fines Mike Tomlin $25,000 for criticizing officiating", "title_full": "Report: NFL fines Mike Tomlin $25,000 for criticizing officiating", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DLdhcwgEaQNyrEQvVnzpLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03ODcuNTkzMTUyMDY0NDUxMQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jlUWzqtilHGKCEL5.DIvKg--~B/aD02MTE7dz05OTM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/df1a7696edebacf7436c720c5cd7deeb", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 80, "comments": 90, "shares": 105}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d770e94ae11a7759c029803b0e4b46d0eb20b6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W.59gPIh5_5EwOBs.zwZ8d68uQqrK4jVzWl6uQHh2Wmgp7kRJSioZy0XPHMKNOluu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report: NFL fines Mike Tomlin $25,000 for criticizing officiating", "text": "Report: NFL fines Mike Tomlin $25,000 for criticizing officiating Charean Williams ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports October 10, 2018, 6:48 PM GMT\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin said earlier this week he didn\u2019t expect the league to fine him for criticizing officials after Sunday\u2019s game.

Columbus Day controversially commemorates Christopher Columbus\u2019 arrival in the Americas, which was followed by mass genocide and colonization of the Native Americans who were there prior to his arrival. Indigenous Peoples Day has been adopted in its stead to celebrate the culture of those native peoples.\nSo, naturally, the Indians donned their racist Native American caricature logo to celebrate the occasion.\nWait \u2026 that can\u2019t be right, can it? No one with a basic grasp of United States history would overlook the horrible irony, right?\nWrong. The Indians donned the Chief Wahoo logo on their sleeves and caps Monday.

A few years ago, the team was phasing out use in favor of its block \u201cC\u201d logo, but continued selling Wahoo-branded gear and wearing Wahoo caps and patches on occasion.\nThe team will continue using the name \u201cIndians,\u201d as well as using Wahoo\u2019s likeness of promotional materials, so this is just a baby step toward eliminating the team\u2019s offensive connections.\nBut if Monday\u2019s game was really Wahoo\u2019s final on-field outing, let us all join in bidding farewell to a logo that will leave as inappropriately as it arrived.

On the back, above the number, is \u201cTRUMP.\u201d There\u2019s even an American flag on one sleeve. Plus, it\u2019s red!

Trump has been vocal in his opposition to players kneeling for the anthem, and tweeted \u201cWhat was Nike thinking?\u201d the day after Kaepernick\u2019s ad went live.

So I really started to go down pretty quickly,\u201d she said.\nGold didn\u2019t reach out to anyone for help, worried her \u201creality would be denied.\u201d She said those semi-close to her reacted that way, telling her she was Gracie Gold and how could she, of all people, be depressed?\n\u201cYou might feel down, but being depressed is when you\u2019re homeless on the street and have nothing to live for. That\u2019s depression,\u201d she said they told her.\nShe said she had \u201csuicidal ideation:\u201d she didn\u2019t want to die, but she couldn\u2019t go on living the way she was living. And if that second part was addressed, she wouldn\u2019t want to die.\nIt was after an outburst at the Team USA camp before the 2017-18 season that she began to get help.\n\u201cMy M.O. in skating was like very plastic Barbie, prim and proper,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for me to tell important people at my federation off, including some profanity, was like very uncharacteristic of me. It\u2019s referred to now as \u2018the incident.\u2019\u201d\nGold was honest, two close Team USA friends helped, and she entered treatment for a month in September 2017. Gold plans return to skating, final Olympics\nGold finished treatment in October 2017, but even for the ambitious athlete a return for the PyeongChang Olympics that winter was too rushed. It would have sent her \u201cright down the rabbit hole,\u201d she said.\nShe lived a \u201cnormal life,\u201d coached a little, and on a request attended the U.S. Championships as a spectator in January . She was reacquainted with the good of figure skating and decided in April she would return. The 2022 Olympics were her ideal retirement year before the pause, and she decided she wanted to end her career on her terms, not the terms of a mental crisis.\nShe switched coaches, now reportedly training with Vincent Resterncourt, who she met at the U.S. Championships. They train in the Delaware/Pennsylvania area and she is scheduled to skate in Moscow next month.\n\u201cSo I fixed myself, in a way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a daily journey, but pulled myself back together, getting back into skating, so that we would have four years for the next Olympics, which was more in my head my ideal retirement.\u201d Gold speaks about mental health stigma, coping mechanisms\nGold and Crawford, who has spoken previously about mental health in his own life, spoke in-depth about the stigma of mental health and what she does now to keep improving.\nApproximately one in five American adults experience a mental health issue and one in 10 young people experience a period of major depression, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .\nYet it\u2019s treated differently than problems we can see for ourselves. Unlike previous injuries, such as a broken foot, Gold didn\u2019t immediately take time off to let herself heal. She heard comments critiquing that choice when she did take a step back.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of injuries; I was never like \u2018Oh my God, Gracie, you suck, you\u2019re the worst athlete, you let everyone down,'\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo, my body needs a break. But when my head wasn\u2019t going well \u2026 \u201c\nNow she spends time to herself in the morning, going over goals for the day, her to-do list and her schedule with coffee in hand. She uses Pinterest to stay positive, pinning quotes and inspiration. If things aren\u2019t going well, she said, she looks out for the \u201csnowball effect\u201d as early as possible to get back on track.\nShe spoke candidly about depression in young adults, calling it a crisis.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a recipe for having great mental health,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy crawford", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gracie gold", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "no bull biz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T03:39:48.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecdd16255b9fc74cb6576d175563e5820112a77e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WNHSCYWD7RBE7LvemlMGHL81L4cuTgGMadrpvy1g3TU7SplpaYzEQvaH2XA.agHEzal8inXgARJLz8aLfXvHhkdjHVDkVSD4S7kGW9xboTS4-", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "How Boston manager Alex Cora earned the trust of the Red Sox", "title_full": "How Boston manager Alex Cora earned the trust of the Red Sox", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.074, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TfZOvtSjJm2is435u8vuMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6MyGlBDxCG9zJRga4xrlw--~B/aD0yODM2O3c9NDI1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7aeef7571eeaeee5c28df8ca13096c7a", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 247, "comments": 69, "shares": 125}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecdd16255b9fc74cb6576d175563e5820112a77e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WNHSCYWD7RBE7LvemlMGHL81L4cuTgGMadrpvy1g3TU7SplpaYzEQvaH2XA.agHEzal8inXgARJLz8aLfXvHhkdjHVDkVSD4S7kGW9xboTS4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeff Passanmlb Columnistyahoo Sportsoctober", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Boston manager Alex Cora earned the trust of the Red Sox", "text": "Yahoo Sports October 10, 2018, 8:35 AM GMT\nNEW YORK \u2013 Long before he led the Boston Red Sox to a franchise-record 108 victories, before he drubbed the New York Yankees by managing a near-perfect postseason series, before the American League Championship Series beckoned and a World Series berth stood four victories away, Alex Cora needed a favor.\nWhen he called Rick Porcello and Chris Sale in January, they were glad to hear from him. Over the previous two months, as he prepared to drop into the snake pit that is the Red Sox manager\u2019s office, Cora had traversed the country, meeting with players, soliciting their advice, listening to their grievances, cautioning them of his plans. Not long ago, Cora had been a player, which meant he understood the dynamics of the modern clubhouse. He also recognized that every new job comes with blind spots, and he took pains to seek them out and confront them, because the best managers in baseball aren\u2019t considered as such purely out of tactical genius or personal affinity but the quality that bridges the two: trust.\nCora knew that the manager could serve as the fulcrum for a clubhouse of 25 men, with diverse backgrounds and differing personalities, so long as he offered his unwavering support. Now, though, he needed them to be here for him, for his homeland. So he asked Porcello and Sale, two of the Red Sox\u2019s veterans and leaders, to join him on a goodwill trip to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.\n\u201cOf course we said yes,\u201d Porcello said late Tuesday night, as the visiting clubhouse staff at Yankee Stadium peeled plastic wrap off the floor and cleared the detritus of the celebration after the Red Sox throttled the Yankees , 4-3, and locked up their American League Division Series with a three-games-to-one victory. \u201cWe knew how important it was to him.\u201d Rookie manager Alex Cora has gained the trust and respect of the Boston Red Sox. (Getty Images)\nWhen Porcello said he would join Cora on the plane to deliver supplies to his hometown of Caguas, the two had met once. They had continued to speak on and off, Cora asking about the leadership on the Red Sox, the flaws of the team, the areas in which he could help, and the comfort was instantaneous, the rapport natural. So this favor \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like an imposition to Porcello or Sale, who took a separate flight from the one Cora, Porcello and other Red Sox employees rode from Boston on Jan. 30 carrying some of the 10 tons of supplies Cora had procured. They almost felt duty-bound, all for someone who\u2019d never managed them in a single game. Story Continues\nThis is what Alex Cora has brought to Boston. The effusiveness with which the Red Sox speak about him is almost cult-like, and yet those around the team swear it\u2019s real, that the 42-year-old\u2019s genuineness invites loyalty without asking for it. That when he\u2019s interviewing for the manager\u2019s job and says a condition of it is the Red Sox helping victims of Hurricane Maria, the authenticity is undeniable. That when 300 families are seeking help and he\u2019s there with a convoy of people to provide, it emanates from the same compass he uses in uniform, one he perpetually hopes points toward good.\n\u201cFor somebody who\u2019s managing in his first year, it sure doesn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d Porcello said. \u201cHe seems like he\u2019s been doing this for a long, long time. What we feel in this clubhouse is how much he really, truly, genuinely cares about us. It kind of sounds like a clich\u00e9. \u2018Whatever. You guys are professional athletes. Who gives a [expletive]?\u2019 But it means a lot. His job is to put guys in a position to succeed. We may be ballplayers and maybe not the most educated people in the world, but you sense those sort of things, who\u2019s leading the helm, and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him. I\u2019m so grateful to be here, to be playing for him. It\u2019s not bull[expletive]. It\u2019s not anything other than I love the fact that I\u2019m playing for Alex Cora and the Boston Red Sox right now.\u201d\n***\nWhen he arrived at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday afternoon, Chris Sale came through the clubhouse door, saw Alex Cora and uttered four words: \u201cI want the ball.\u201d\nCora laughed. Sale is arguably the best pitcher in the AL, certainly on the Mount Rushmore of active pitchers, and had the Red Sox not won Game 4, Sale was set to start the fifth and deciding game. He was signaling to Cora that if he wanted him for an inning in relief, Sale was ready. Pitchers notoriously ask for the ball, and Sale doing so after a season in which he twice went on the disabled list with shoulder fatigue might\u2019ve been a red flag had Cora not spent the season getting to know Sale, his desires, his life, his family, and earning his faith enough that Sale knew better than to lie about his fitness to pitch.\nA year ago to the day, Sale had pitched in relief, too. It was Game 4 of the Red Sox\u2019s Division Series against the Houston Astros . When he entered in the fourth inning, Boston trailed by a run. Then the Red Sox took a one-run lead. Sale was cruising until the eighth inning, when Alex Bregman tied the game with a leadoff home run. Houston went ahead when Sale left with a runner on base and closer Craig Kimbrel allowed him to score. The game still haunts Sale.\n\u201cI try to learn from every experience and learn, obviously, from my mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first go at it was godawful. It was as bad as it can get. And I think going through that made me better for this situation here and hopefully going forward. I look a lot at what happened the first time around and obviously trying to flip the script, and here we are.\u201d\nHere they were, eighth inning this time, Red Sox leading the Yankees, 4-1. They had scratched across three runs against veteran starter CC Sabathia and scored another on a home run from catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez , another Cora sleight of hand in a series full of them. V\u00e1zquez, a Puerto Rico native who also went on the Caguas relief trip, hadn\u2019t played in the postseason. He hadn\u2019t caught Porcello, the Game 4 starter, all year. Cora sought the platoon advantage with the right-handed V\u00e1zquez against the left-handed Sabathia. He was rewarded.\nSale had gone to the bullpen three innings earlier, had warmed up in the seventh, and with Boston\u2019s thin relief corps its greatest weakness, Cora wasn\u2019t leaving it up to chance.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Cora said he shouted to the dugout, \u201cwe\u2019re all in. He\u2019s coming in.\u201d\nThe Red Sox\u2019s dugout stirred. The bullpen door swung open. Sale, all 6-foot-6 and 180 pounds of him, all skin and bones and left arm, was jogging to the mound.\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to win,\u201d first baseman Mitch Moreland said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was.\u201d Chris Sale asked for the ball and pitched the eighth inning for the Red Sox in Game 4 vs. the Yankees. (Getty Images)\nAs Sale shut down the Yankees to propel Boston to the ninth, it felt, to the Red Sox, like the culmination of something. Like the 162 games that brought them to that moment weren\u2019t simply a talented team playing out the string. They meant something. They fortified this group. They showed that what Cora had done gave him the capital to bring Chris Sale in and not get sideways looks or second guesses but something more representative of the unmitigated optimism that\u2019s his calling card. The Red Sox trusted him just as he trusts them.\nVeteran second baseman Ian Kinsler trusted Cora to play Brock Holt in Game 3, and Holt responded with the first cycle in playoff history and the Red Sox handed the Yankees their worst postseason loss in the nearly 400 games they\u2019ve played. Porcello trusted Cora when he called his number out of the bullpen in Game 1, and then when they agreed that he should push back his start from Game 3 to 4. And Nathan Eovaldi trusted Cora when he asked to move his scheduled start up a day and shut down the Yankees in the third game.\n\u201cWe all have an understanding that we\u2019re all here to do what it takes to win a championship,\u201d Kinsler said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it comes down to. There are no egos in here. There\u2019s no \u2018I did it\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m mad because someone else did it.\u2019 Alex doesn\u2019t care who gets it done. And we all trust each other. We all believe in each other. We\u2019re all here to win a championship. It\u2019s pretty easy when everybody\u2019s pulling in the same direction.\u201d\nFor six months in the season, and six weeks in spring training, and the three months before that when he was going to Texas and Florida and all over the place to meet face-to-face with his players, Alex Cora was laying the groundwork for Game 4. He had earned it. It was going to be Rick Porcello and Chris Sale coming together to help him this time. And the rewards were going to be awfully handsome.\n***\nThen came the ninth inning. Baseball is funny like that. Alex Cora had managed a spotless series, and Sale\u2019s clean frame set him up the ideal scenario: Craig Kimbrel for three outs. Past playoff foibles aside, Cora wanted Kimbrel because he\u2019s one of the most dominant closers in history, and a three-run cushion felt like plenty until it didn\u2019t.\nWalk. Single. Strikeout. Walk. Hit by pitch. It was 4-2. Sacrifice fly on a ball with the bases loaded that landed 7 feet shy of the left-field fence. It was 4-3. Kimbrel teetered. Cora got up Joe Kelly in the bullpen, just in case, the sort of thing Cora\u2019s counterpart, Aaron Boone, hadn\u2019t done for two consecutive days. In the Game 3 blowout , leaving in starter Luis Severino for too long helped contribute to the historic loss. On Tuesday, Boone stuck with starter CC Sabathia for three innings in which he allowed Boston to tag him for three runs before Vazquez\u2019s home run.\nTruth is, Kimbrel wasn\u2019t going anywhere. This was his game. He gathered himself, induced a weak ground ball from rookie Gleyber Torres , watched third baseman Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez field it and throw on the run, leaned with everyone else as first baseman Steve Pearce barely kept his toe on the base for the final out, sweated a replay review and then started to celebrate. It was an ugly save. It was closer to an abject meltdown. Cora stuck with Kimbrel anyway.\n\u201cHe knows his players very, very well,\u201d Kinsler said. \u201cHe knows them inside and out. And he trusts his players. There\u2019s trust and respect. Those are two things that are huge when it comes to sports. He doesn\u2019t handcuff anybody. He believes in his guys, and it shows. Guys love playing for him.\u201d\nAt 12:09 a.m., barely a half-hour after they\u2019d clinched their spot in the ALCS against the Houston Astros \u2013 with whom Cora won the World Series last year as bench coach \u2013 the stereo in the clubhouse turned from triumphant hip-hop tracks to an old-school jam. Sly smiles spread across the faces of those in the know as the first words strained across the speakers: \u201cStart spreadin\u2019 the news \u2026 \u201d\nAs he left Fenway Park following the Yankees\u2019 victory in Game 2 , outfielder Aaron Judge carried a boombox playing \u201cNew York, New York. \u201d Now Boston was engaging in a delicious bit of counter-trolling, playing the Yankees\u2019 victory song during a Red Sox celebration. The rivalry is alive and well, from the players to the managers to the fan bases, each more invigorated than they\u2019ve been in years. Alex Cora is impossible to quantify, and yet the fashion in which he out-managed Boone in the Division Series is likewise impossible to deny. (Getty Images)\nIn Boston, particularly, they fell in love with this Red Sox team over the summer. It\u2019s not one without weaknesses. The Astros may be favored in the ALCS, even if Boston gets home-field advantage with Game 1 on Saturday. They\u2019re beloved because the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. How much of that is directly attributable to Alex Cora is impossible to quantify, and yet the fashion in which he out-managed Boone in the Division Series is likewise impossible to deny.\nOn they go, to a place Sale has never been, a place where Porcello last went with Detroit in 2013, when the Tigers lost to the last Red Sox championship team. Four wins there, and it\u2019s the World Series. Four wins there, and it\u2019s a parade.

Manchester City \u2013 A Manchester City are unbeaten after eight games, have won six and drawn two games, have the best attack in the league, the joint-best defence in the league and yet, it still feels like they haven\u2019t hit top gear yet. That is a worrying thought for other teams, but City certainly deserve an A and have began their title defence in impressive fashion. 2. Chelsea \u2013 A* Chelsea have outperformed all expectations so far and the question is not whether they will finish in the top four, but whether or not they are bonafide title contenders. Eden Hazard\u2019s been the league\u2019s best player, David Luiz looks like a man transformed and Jorginho is the new pass-master. Eden Hazard\u2019s stunning displays have helped Chelsea adapt to life under Maurizio Sarri easily. More 3. Liverpool \u2013 A Some people might think an A is too generous, given Liverpool have not won in four games in all competitions. But they would be wrong. Liverpool have played three of top six already and remain unbeaten, their two draws coming at Chelsea and yesterday against Manchester City. Like City, they haven\u2019t been at their very best yet. 4. Arsenal \u2013 B+ Unai Emery\u2019s Gunners mesmerised at Fulham to make it six league wins in a row and lead some fans to chant \u2018we\u2019ve got our Arsenal back\u2019. Whilst Arsenal have picked up results and seem to be improving with every game, the early season defeats to Man City and Chelsea mean they fall just short of being awarded an A. 5. Spurs \u2013 B The mini-blip that Spurs suffered either side of the last international break seems to be over, yet Spurs have not convinced and seem to be playing at a level lower than the last couple of years. Injuries have played a part and they do deserve credit for only sitting two points behind City, Liverpool and Chelsea, it just feels like something is lacking, and it\u2019s not only down to injuries. 6. AFC Bournemouth \u2013 A Eddie Howe\u2019s Bournemouth are desperately unlucky not to be awarded an A* here, but a 4-0 defeat at Burnley can do that to you. A stunning start to the season for the league\u2019s smallest club and they look well-placed for their best finish of the Premier League era and most importantly, they are fun to watch. Bravo, Eddie. 7. Wolves \u2013 A There was a real intrigue prior to the season about how well Wolves might do in this league and they have impressed already. Their only defeat came in the second game of the season, they have won four of the last five and drew at Old Trafford in the only game they did not win. If they were more clinical infront of goal, things could get even better. 8. Manchester United \u2013 D While the rest of the big six have either played well, or picked up points despite indifferent displays, Manchester United have not. Paul Pogba v Jose Mourinho, journalists v Jose Mourinho, Anthony Martial v Jose Mourinho, Antonio Valencia v Jose Mourinho, the 16th worst defence in the Premier League, defeats to Brighton, West Ham and Spurs, a draw at home to Wolves. No matter what Jose may say, it\u2019s been dismal for United. 9. Watford \u2013 B Watford\u2019s stunning start seems a long way off now after three defeats and a draw in their past four games. It certainly is not doom and gloom at Vicarage Road and 13 points from eight games is a decent haul, but their grade has certainly dropped since the last international break. Story Continues 10. Leicester City \u2013 C Claude Puel is probably content to see Leicester sitting tenth at this stage, yet he\u2019ll know that Leicester need more. Fans are still not convinced by the Frenchman and three of their four wins have come against teams in the bottom five. Very much all or nothing, with no draws this season. Richarlison has thrived under Marco Silva, just like he did at Watford. More 11. Everton \u2013 C Two wins in their past two games have improved the mood at Goodison Park, but the jury remains very much out on Marco Silva amongst the Everton faithful. They sit 11th, have 12 points from their eight games and in Richarlison, have a star in the making. But they have played just one of the top six so far, which makes the points tally look a little worse. 12. Burnley \u2013 B It might be odd to see a team who finished seventh last year and are currently four points behind 11th-placed Everton given a better mark than the teams above them, but it\u2019s how Bunley have reacted. They have turned one point from five games into eight from eight and without the Europa League, Burnley look much more like the team we saw last year. Sean Dyche\u2019s side are trending in the right direction. 13. Brighton \u2013 C Brighton also have eight points, a tally that should not be sniffed at when you consider they have already played Manchester City, Spurs, Manchester United and Liverpool. Coming from two goals down to pick up points against Fulham and Southampton speak for their character too and Seagulls fans should be fairly optimistic. READ MORE: West Ham lay down final contract offer to Declan Rice 14. Crystal Palace \u2013 D The Eagles only have one point less than rivals Brighton, but there are plenty of reasons to worry. Just three goals scored since their opening day victory over Fulham and none of them have come at home, they\u2019ve only played Liverpool in the top six and failed to take advantage of some easier home games. 15. West Ham \u2013 C The outlook at the London Stadium is far better than it was one month ago and things are looking up, despite defeat at Brighton meaning it is five losses from eight games. Seven points from home games with Chelsea and Manchester United, as well as a trip to Everton, is an impressive feat and all the signs are that players are responding to Manuel Pellegrini. 16. Southampton \u2013 D Mark Hughes\u2019 Southampton look set for a relegation battle, simply because they aren\u2019t very good. Since throwing away a two-goal lead at home to Brighton, Saints have lost three games in a row, conceding eight and scoring none in the process. Their solitary victory at Palace feels like a long time ago. Fulham\u2019s 5-1 defeat to Arsenal set off alarm bells, if they weren\u2019t already ringing. More 17. Fulham \u2013 D It has been a really disappointing start to Premier League life for Fulham. Plenty of new signings came in, but Slavisa Jokanovic is yet to work out his best side, having made changes to his defence for every single game. The manner in which they lost to Arsenal is a worry too and any pre-season optimism that Fulham might surprise the league has gone. 18. Huddersfield \u2013 E Huddersfield have not had the easiest start fixture wise and they have had a couple of decent results, but it\u2019s still been poor on the whole. A draw with Cardiff and defeat at home to Crystal Palace stick out and the Terriers have six less points than they did at this stage last year. At the minute, David Wagner\u2019s side look nothing more than relegation fodder. 19. Newcastle United \u2013 E A poor summer in the transfer market has been followed by a dreadful start to the season for the Toon Army. They\u2019ve played five of the top six already, but failing to score in games with Cardiff, Palace, and Leicester is a real worry for Newcastle. Rafael Benitez appears immortal to fans, that could change if they are cut adrift. 20. Cardiff City \u2013 F It is not surprising that a side full of Championship quality players, managed by a Championship manager are struggling badly in the top-flight. It was never going to be easy for the Bluebirds, but they have had some really poor results and it almost feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy now: Neil Warnock emphasis how tough it will be, so his player have stopped believing they can cause upsets. The talk is whether they can reach 12 points and avoid breaking Derby County\u2019s for the least amount of points in a Premier League season, not if they can stay up. That says a lot.

The photo Nurmagomedov posted depicts him with a laughing smile and the caption: \u201cMy face when someone says that I didn\u2019t like my jump, but I tried so hard. I hope I didn't hurt anyone's feelings with this leap.\u201d The move is however unlikely to show the remorse required by the Nevada State Athletic Commission who have held back Nurmagomedov\u2019s $2 million fight purse after he scaled the cage to launch a flying kick at Conor McGregor\u2019s stablemate Dillon Danis.

The commission will also decide whether the Russian fighter will be stripped of the UFC Lightweight crown which he claimed after forcing McGregor to submit to a rear naked choke in the fourth round of their one-sided contest. Nurgamedov did offer a sincere apology for jumping into the crowd at the post-fight press conference in the early hours of Sunday morning but then added the caveat that he didn\u2019t understand how people could criticise him while not condemning McGregor\u2019s consistently offensive remarks in the build-up to their long-awaited clash. \u201cThis is not my best side. He talked about my religion, my country, my father. He came to Brooklyn, he broke bus and nearly killed two people. So why do people still talk about me jumping over the cage? I have shown respect.\u201d \u201cThis is a respectful sport. This is not a trash-talking sport. I want to change this game. You cannot talk about religions and nations.

The rumblings of discontent which occupied the steps leading from Arsenal tube station to The Emirates pitch have subdued. In fact, only somewhere in-between does the last remnant of the Arsene Wenger era lie. A pair of Japanese tourists exchange photographs in front of the cast bronze statue of Thierry Henry. A baldy old-timer attempts to tackle Tony Adams\u2019 historic celebration. But there his bust sits, stuffed away in the entrance to the directors\u2019 box. Well, half a bust. The greatest manager in Arsenal\u2019s history has only been preserved for his head and shoulders. As the fans sung \u201cwe\u2019ve got our Arsenal back\u201d on Sunday at Craven Cottage, it felt as though Wenger\u2019s influence at the club had truly been confined to that statue, to history. The juncture at which the rehearsal under Unai Emery could be declared as over, as successful. The dress curtain lifted to reveal the workings of the new stage director. READ MORE: 'Angry' Higuain seeking Juventus revenge - Del Piero Emery has only been at the helm for twelve games, but with each Arsenal has steadily become a team of his grain. It wasn\u2019t with the splash of a wellington which he has imprinted his, but a slow streak of the foot across a silk carpet, meticulously sweeping each thread into a unanimous direction. The opening stanza on Sunday was the archetypal Arsenal performance of recent years. A crooked leaking gutter of a back line and a lack of imagination in the final third. Although Fulham could only rob one on the half-time whistle, they should have had three if it weren't for their wasteful finishing. But it was in the second half that mud did fly. It\u2019s not to say Arsenal won\u2019t revert from the glorious football that saw them score four goals in the second half to the drear first, but it will no longer be a regression into the old Arsenal, Wenger\u2019s Arsenal. This is a squad, a kingdom of a club, now firmly under Emery\u2019s reign. Emery has breathed new life into Arsenal (Getty) More But there is one vital aspect which Emery has restored rather than originated: youth. Wenger\u2019s reputation was often defined in unearthing and evolving prospects, whether from the club\u2019s academy or from overseas. But during his last decade at the club, of the 16 players aged 23 or under brought in only two became established first-team regulars - Aaron Ramsey and Granit Xhaka. But in the short stint since taking over, Emery has already revitalised the identity known as the \u2018Arsenal DNA\u2019. If Jorginho has been described as the metronome of Chelsea\u2019s midfield, Lucas Torreira (22) is the cartoon wrecking ball, theatrically thwacking into a titchy house in a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The diminutive Uruguayan made six of Arsenal\u2019s thirteen interceptions and recovered the ball eight times at Craven Cottage and was honour with the theme of a chant last reserved for Patrick Vieira. Matteo Guendouzi (19), who was sourced from the backside of the French second division has played more games at Arsenal than he had in his entire senior career prior to joining. His introduction on Sunday, and immediate tendency to lift through balls from the midfield anchor in the ilk of Alex Song, showed how he is every bit the successor to Xhaka whose passing has become a lateral constancy. Story Continues Torreira made six interceptions on Sunday (Getty) More Emile Smith Rowe (18), said he never had the chance to speak to Wenger in his nine years in the academy but looks to be one of the most exciting prospects in English football. And, at this point, nobody more so than Alex Iwobi (22) himself will have been surprised to receive a rapturous standing ovation when substituted on the 67th minute at Craven Cottage. Iwobi was the final academy graduate to cement his position at least in the squad during Wenger\u2019s final years but became increasingly laboured and benched last season. The introduction - or reformation in Iwobi\u2019s case - of these four players epitomises how Emery has revived the cycle of youth which breathes new life into a team - such is the \u2018Arsenal way\u2019. Hungry prospects who enforce that pre-existing players take on paternal responsibilities as seniors in the squad, as leaders - a role which has been shirked in an effectively captainless side. Just over six years ago, Arsenal played out a drab 3-3 draw here at the Emirates. Yesterday, just ten miles south, the crowd joked \u201cwe want six\u201d after securing their ninth win in a row. And while Wenger may be confined to holidays in Corsica or an insufficient statue sheltered by visiting swathes to the directors\u2019 box, his ideology has returned to the pitch rather than the concourse. Because for all the rebranding under Emery, the \u2018Arsenal DNA\u2019 which Wenger so famously birthed then betrayed has been resurrected in his absence.

Conte has already been linked to both the Manchester United and Real Madrid jobs, while he is also a potential target for Bayern Munich following the German club\u2019s poor start to the season. Chelsea sacked Conte three months ago, but are yet to reach an agreement with their former head coach over his severance. Under the terms of the final year of his contract, the 49-year-old would be due over \u00a39 million but Chelsea have tried to argue that he contributed to his own dismissal and are reluctant to agree to a full pay-out. READ MORE: Barkley feels more mature as a player after two-year England absence The matter could go to court if both sides refuse to back down, but the impasse may also be impacted by whether or not United see Conte as a potential mid-season successor to under-pressure Jose Mourinho . Mourinho\u2019s job was saved by United\u2019s second-half fightback against Newcastle United, but the Portuguese wants public backing from the club\u2019s owners and must take his team to Chelsea after the international break. Under the terms of his Chelsea deal, Conte would forgo any compensation owed to him from the time he took over at another English club but that is not thought to apply if he goes overseas. That means taking the United job before the New Year could cost Conte at least \u00a35m, but he would be able to take over at Real or Bayern and still negotiate a Chelsea pay-off. Conte brought the Premier League title and FA Cup to Stamford Bridge in his two years in charge More Zinedine Zidane had been the favourite to take over at United if Mourinho is sacked , but the Frenchman\u2019s agent Alain Migliaccio has attempted to distance his client from the role. Sources in Germany have also claimed Zidane would be high on Bayern\u2019s list of targets if they choose to fire Niko Kovac, following a disastrous start to the Bundesliga season that has seen them stop for the international break in sixth place. United\u2019s options to replace Mourinho before the end of the season would be limited, as Tottenham Hotspur are confident Mauricio Pochettino would not leave mid-campaign. Conte is in the rare position of being a top-class manager who is currently out of work, although the nature of his fall-out at Chelsea would be a concern to United. His record of winning the Premier League title and FA Cup during two seasons at Chelsea, and the fact he got the best out of Paul Pogba at Juventus, would however be of interest. Conte has kept a low profile since leaving Chelsea and it is unclear what his managerial intentions are, but he will soon be in demand. Spanish reports have claimed he will be considered by Real Madrid if the European champions decide to sack Julen Lopetegui. Conte turned down an approach from Real during the summer because he was still contracted to Chelsea and had not been sacked at the time. But Real have completed a dismal run of four games without a victory, during which time they have not scored a goal, and Lopetegui\u2019s job could well be on the line when they meet Barcelona on October 28.

As the international break continues to drag, Yahoo Sport UK takes a look at the most expensive signings and grades them on their displays after eight games (sorry Fabinho). 10. Yerry Mina \u00a328.5m (Barcelona \u2013 Everton) \u2013 N/A Well, this is a good start. Yerry Mina cannot be given a grade because he is injured and yet to play a game for Everton. While others on this list have barely played despite being fit, Mina is a special case. Let\u2019s hope he is back soon and helps mend the leaks in the Toffees\u2019 backline. 9. Richarlison \u00a340m (Watford \u2013 Everton) \u2013 A It has been an eventful two months at Goodison Park for Richarlison. He has netted four goals, missed two games after being sent off and missed a hatful of chances. But it is tough to criticise the 21-year-old who has been the standout performer at Everton. Clearly a man who thrives under Marco Silva, Richarlison has begun to justify his fee. Felipe Anderson cost West Ham more than \u00a340m, but how has he done so far? More 8. Felipe Anderson \u00a342m (Lazio \u2013 West Ham United) \u2013 B August: not good, September: very good. That is the best way to describe Felipe Anderson\u2019s season so far. He has been a really key member of the Hammers\u2019 renaissance and scored his first goal against Manchester United. Clearly has ability on the ball and looks to have adapted to the Premier League fairly quickly. 7. Fabinho \u00a343.7m (Monaco \u2013 Liverpool) \u2013 E Liverpool\u2019s transfer business has been widely heralded, yet Fabinho is yet to play a Premier League minute. A Carabao Cup start and two substitute appearances in the Champions League are all Fabinho has to his name, but that isn\u2019t necessarily that surprising. Andy Robertson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took time to adjust last season. That can\u2019t save Fabinho from a low rating though. 6. Naby Keita \u00a352.8m (RB Leipzig \u2013 Liverpool) \u2013 C After his Liverpool debut against West Ham, Naby Keita looked set to be the signing of the summer. But it has been a stuttering start to his Liverpool career; some moments of brilliance mixed in with more anonymous displays. Keita\u2019s not been bad, he\u2019s just not quite lived up to the hype yet. There is plenty of time to shine, though, and this grade should be higher come next May. Jorginho\u2019s calming influence has improved Chelsea greatly More 5. Jorginho \u00a357m (Napoli \u2013 Chelsea) \u2013 A* Snatched from under the noses of Manchester City, the Jorginho \u2013 Maurizio Sarri partnership has blossomed in west London. Jorginho has been one of the key cogs during the Blues\u2019 surprise start to the year, setting records for completed passes in the process. One of the most impressive summer signings of the lot. 4. Riyad Mahrez \u00a360m (Leicester City \u2013 Manchester City) \u2013 C Should one penalty miss lower the rating? Well, it has. Riyad Mahrez has been OK at City without pulling up any trees. A brace at Cardiff looked like it could be the springboard for the Algerian to hit top-form, then he blasted the ball into the Anfield Road Stand and cost his team a potentially huge victory. Story Continues 3. Fred \u00a361.2m (Shakhtar Donestk \u2013 Manchester United) \u2013 C Another expensive signing who has had an underwhelming start to Premier League life. Fred has started just one of United\u2019s past five games and seems to have fallen down the pecking order. He has done alright when he has played, but Scott McTominay getting selected in front of him paints a worrying picture. Was he just signed to spite City? Alisson Becker\u2019s settled in quickly on Merseyside More 2. Alisson Becker \u00a367m (Roma \u2013 Liverpool) \u2013 B That mistake at Leicester City aside, Alisson has looked the part for Liverpool after his expensive move from Roma. He was always going to be an upgrade on Loris Karius, but the fee put pressure on him and he\u2019s coped with it well. Best performance probably came at Chelsea, when two saves at 1-0 paved the way for Daniel Sturridge\u2019s stunning equaliser. 1. Kepa Arrizabalaga \u00a372.1m (Athletic Bilbao \u2013 Chelsea) \u2013 A The world\u2019s most expensive goalkeeper has managed to stay under the radar for much of the season, which is usually a good thing as a keeper. When he\u2019s been called upon Kepa has made some fine saves, including a memorable one from Sadio Mane in the clash with Liverpool. No mistakes in his first eight games is good, especially when you consider the baptism of fire fellow Spaniard David De Gea had when he first joined.

The Redskins allowed 447 total yards and struggled to apply pressure when it counted, including on the record-breaking touchdown pass.\nThe dismantling of the Redskins was not just on one side of the ball.\nQuarterback Alex Smith struggled against New Orleans' defense. This was the fifth consecutive game Washington have not scored a touchdown in the third quarter, dating back to last year.\nWashington scored their first second-half touchdown of the season early in the fourth quarter, but the efforts were too little too late.\nThe loss leaves the NFC East wide open while, the Saints' victory pushed them past the Carolina Panthers for top spot in the NFC South.\nBrees cements his name in record books\nFans packed the Superdome in hopes of seeing Brees surpass Manning as the NFL's all-time leading passer. The 18-year QB accomplished that feat in the second quarter when he put the Saints up 26-6, but he was just getting started.\nNew Orleans came out of the half and continued to dominate Washington's defense.\nBrees finished 26-of-29 passing for 363 yards and three touchdowns. He utilised Ingram, who made his 2018 debut after finishing a four-game suspension, and Tre'Quan Smith. Smith made the record-breaking reception for a touchdown that put Brees over the hump.\nBrees now sits at 499 career touchdowns, one away from the illustrious 500 mark that he will surely break in weeks to come.\nIngram's return wasn't overshadowed Story Continues\nIngram was due back on the field when Brees was predicted to break Manning's record, leaving many to wonder if the former's return would be overshadowed.\nThe two-time Pro Bowl running back quickly silenced that talk. After Brees completed a short pass to Ingram that eventually put the Saints on the two-yard line, the latter recorded the team's first touchdown a play later to give New Orleans an early lead.\nIngram was suspended for four games after violating the league policy on performance-enhancing substances. It was the first time in his career that he has been away from a team at any level, and he made his presence felt when he returned to the field.\nHe finished with 53 yards on 16 carries and two touchdowns.\nAn undisciplined defense didn't do Washington any favors\nThere was no excuse for why the Redskins showed up to NOLA unprepared.\nTop top-ranked total defense had an early bye week, which should have given them more than enough time to prepare for one of their toughest matchups of the season.\nBut when Washington took the field, the defensive unit lacked the necessary discipline needed to stop Brees and company.\nThe Redskins racked up six penalties that extended some of the Saints' early drives. They could have bounced back from the 38 yards lost on penalties, but allowed Ingram to establish a steady run game \u2014 and of course, Brees' record outing. It was the most yards (447) Washington have allowed since week 14 of the 2017 season against the Los Angeles Chargers.\nIt was a showing that did not do Washington any favours as they battle through a division that is anyone's game.

Brees hit Tre'Quan Smith down the sideline for the record and began to build his edge over Manning as Smith went 62 yards for a touchdown.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to happen on the first play to Tre\u2019Quan,\u201d Brees said, via the Associated Press . \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it could have happened in any better fashion than it did.

(AP)\nPhiladelphia 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid is signing with Under Armour, sources told Yahoo Sports, with the endorsement deal expected to be finalized Wednesday. Embiid appears ready to test the theory that the NBA\u2019s tallest stars can\u2019t sell shoes.\nEmbiid is entering his fifth season with the 76ers \u2014 his third actually playing \u2014 after being selected No. 3 overall in the 2014 NBA draft. Embiid\u2019s unique skill set and social-media presence \u2014 particularly on Twitter and Instagram \u2014 have made him one of the NBA\u2019s most marketable and popular stars.\n[ Yahoo Fantasy Basketball leagues are open: Sign up now for free ]\nThe move by Under Armour gives the shoe company, which has been hurt by a declining stock price in recent years, a co-star at the highest levels of the NBA to go along with Steph Curry .\nThe move doesn\u2019t come as a complete surprise to the sneakerheads that follow the industry closely, as Embiid was considered the top sneaker free agent on the market.\nEmbiid has been spotted wearing Under Armour shoes this preseason, including at 76ers media day. He told ESPN about his desire to have a signature shoe while the Sixers were in China recently: \u201cA lot of people, you know, always have that notion [that] big men can\u2019t sell shoes. When I look at myself \u2026 I\u2019m more than a big man. So as far as signature shoes, I\u2019m excited to come and break that.\u201d\nEmbiid missed his first two seasons in the NBA with injuries.

More Roger Federer began the defence of his Shanghai Masters title with a hard-fought second-round victory over Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday. In his first outing since a surprise US Open fourth-round defeat to John Millman last month, Federer ousted the in-form Russian 6-4 4-6 6-4 in a high-quality encounter. Medvedev came into this clash on the back of his third career title in Tokyo on Sunday, while only Juan Martin del Potro has more hard-court wins in 2018 than the world number 22. And what looked like a stern test for Federer on paper proved to be exactly that in reality as the Swiss was taken the distance before his opponent ultimately crumbled at the crucial juncture late in the third set. Federer, chasing a third crown in Shanghai, will face Roberto Bautista Agut in the next round as he continues his preparations towards the ATP World Tour Finals. Throughout much of the contest, Medvedev looked assured in exalted company after recovering from a nervy opening which saw him start with a double-fault as Federer broke in the first game. Medvedev was soon back on serve at 2-2 but Federer turned the screw at 4-4, breaking again as his opponent went long before a serve and volley saw him edge ahead. In the second, the Swiss was forced to applaud a stunning backhand volley on the stretch from Medvedev at 2-2 \u2013 one that actually saw the ball land on the Russian's side of the net on the second bounce \u2013 and the world number two was taken to a decider as the underdog put away a crunching forehand. A thrilling deciding set unfolded with each man saving a break point until, at 4-4 30-30, Medvedev produced two awful forehands to present his opponent with an opening. It was an invitation unlikely to be passed up, Federer seeing out victory with a resounding ace out wide.

That also helps. \"I've always played as a left-back, except on some occasions in Italy for Fiorentina where they put me on the other side. But my natural fit is on the left.

That incident sparked a melee that saw some of Nurmagomedov's crew spill into the Octagon to attack McGregor.\nOnce things regained some semblance of order, the Nevada State Athletic Commission began reviewing video footage of what transpired and decided to withhold Nurmagomedov's $2 million fight purse, though it released McGregor's $3 million check.\nNow, UFC president Dana White has some strong opinions on what the commission should do to Nurmagomedov, although he doesn't have the authority to determine what the commission's eventual ruling will be.\n\"There's too many people who don't understand why he did it, but he shouldn't have done it,\" White told TMZ Sports on Monday.\n\"(The commission) took his whole purse right now, and they're talking about keeping his purse. I do not think that that should happen. They should not be able to keep his whole purse.\"\nSo what does White think they should do? He wouldn't have them keep his entire purse, but he believes there are some pretty serious sanctions that should and could happen.\n\"I think they should take a quarter of a million dollars from him,\" White said, when pressed on what he thought the commission should do, though he insisted that Nurmagomedov would not be stripped of the UFC lightweight belt.\n\"Oh, he absolutely keeps his title. And, he's gonna get suspended. So maybe you give him a four to six month suspension.\"\nNSAC chairman Anthony Marnell on Monday said that McGregor would also be facing the commission for his actions during the incident as well. McGregor was caught on video trying to scale the fence to get out of the Octagon and taking swings at other individuals in the cage.

Liverpool star told he needs trophies to top Real Madrid skipper A Dutch defender at Anfield is considered to be one of the world's finest, but Jamie Carragher feels silverware is required to be the very best Virgil van Dijk is \u201cright in the top group\u201d when it comes to the world\u2019s best defenders, says Jamie Carragher, but the Liverpool star has been told he needs trophies in order to overtake the likes of Real Madrid skipper Sergio Ramos. Liverpool reached the Champions League final last season, before coming unstuck against Madrid, while a Premier League title challenge is being pieced together on the back of an unbeaten start in 2018-19 . Van Dijk has played a key role in making the Reds competitive, but the Netherlands international is still lacking the silverware which marks serial winner Ramos and his World Cup-winning club colleague Raphael Varane out as the very best in the business. READ MORE: 'Mourinho can win the Premier League title' - Ibrahimovic Ex-Liverpool star Carragher told Soccer AM on the battle for global supremacy and Van Dijk\u2019s current standing: \u201cI think he\u2019s right in the top group. Some people may put him top. \u201cI would just hang fire with that with the fact he hasn\u2019t won the biggest trophies yet. I think you have to do that. \u201cYou want to be known as the best in whatever position, you\u2019ve got to have something on the CV - Premier League, Champions League. \u201cHe got to the final last season.

Javi Gracia is poised to sign a new three-year, long-term contract as Watford head coach. His representatives have met with officials of the Premier League club and an agreement is close to being announced. Gracia has hugely impressed since taking over from Marco Silva last January when Watford were on a run of just one win in l1 league matches and in danger of getting sucked into the relegation places. READ MORE: Cardiff lose appeal against Joe Ralls' red card The 48-year-old endured a tough start but Watford stayed up, beating Chelsea along the way, and have undoubtedly pushed on. Gracia\u2019s work in re-organising the team, integrating some key players who appeared to have been marginalised, such as Troy Deeney and Etienne Capoue, and developing young talent such as Will Hughes, who was unfortunate not receive an England call-up alongside team-mate Nathaniel Chalobah, has not gone unnoticed. Awarding the Spaniard a three-year deal, as sources close to him have suggested will be agreed, would also appear significant as it is a sign not just that Watford are happy with Gracia\u2019s work but are striving for more longevity with their managerial appointment. Silva, for example, was on a two-year deal. Gracia is the 10 th Watford head coach to work at the club since the Pozzo family acquired it in 2012 and although the coaches left for different reasons, and the club continued to thrive, a longer-term appointment would also help progress and provide a little more continuity in the dug-out. Gracia was the Premier League's manager of the month in August as Watford made a flying start Credit: GETTY IMAGES More Gracia, who was out-of-work when he was hired by Watford, having left Russian club Rubin Kazan the previous June, signed an initial 18-month deal which currently takes him up until the end of this season. The new contract would remove any uncertainty over the future of the 48-year-old who last summer was also the first Watford head coach to stay in charge from the end of the previous season since 2014. Gracia also works hard on the training ground and enjoys a good relationship with the club\u2019s hierarchy and fits the mould of the kind of manager they want in being a coach first. That benefit was felt from the start of the season when Watford enjoyed a run of four straight wins with victories over Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur. Gracia was subsequently named manager of the month for August. Watford are currently ninth in the table on 13 points after eight games. They were unfortunate to lose against Arsenal and Manchester United and although they were heavily beaten by Bournemouth last weekend the dismissal of Christian Kabasele was a contributing factor. Pundits had cast Watford as relegation candidates, especially after selling Richarlison to Everton for \u00a340million and not buying a striker, but the club are confounding those predictions. From their summer transfer dealings only goalkeeper Ben Foster has gone straight into the first-team but Gracia has worked on improving what he inherited and what is a strong squad and is set to be rewarded. Gracia is also a disciplinarian \u2013 a new fines system has been introduced while the players \u2018clock-in\u2019 every morning as they arrive for training \u2013 but is a popular figure at the club and operates an \u2018open door\u2019 policy. Story Continues He has adjusted well to English football having gained promotions in Spain with Cadiz and Almeria before impressively guiding cash-strapped Malaga to two top-half finishes in La Liga. Gracia\u2019s new contract is expected to be announced in the next few weeks. It is also expected that Watford\u2019s dispute with Everton over Marco Silva will come to a head after an independent inquiry into the alleged \u201ctapping up\u201d of the Portuguese was launched. Watford were enraged by Everton\u2019s pursuit of Silva last season. Having been fifth in table when Ronald Koeman was sacked as Everton manager on October 23, leading to a five-week long saga of trying to hire Silva, Watford were in 10 th place but just five points outside the relegation zone when the Portuguese was dismissed. Watford had made it clear they would not entertain an approach for their manager, who did not have a break clause in his two-year deal, and rejected financial offers from Everton. They eventually made a formal complaint over Everton's conduct. The case is now in the hands of lawyers appointed by the Premier League to examine the evidence and basis for any charge.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said Thursday significant ''storm clouds'' are hanging over college athletics because of a basketball recruiting scandal displaying what many see as the sleazy side of the sport.\nDelany cited a federal trial that began in New York last week following an FBI investigation, and he said there is a ''pattern'' at certain schools. He also insisted the vast majority of programs are following the rules.\n''I would say as negative as it is - no doubt that they are storm clouds of a significant magnitude - we have 300 Division I institutions and we have 1,000 players that are being recruited every year,'' he said. ''While these are not isolated, I think they are at a certain level of recruitment and at certain institutions appear to be a pattern. These are not to be dismissed (and are to be) taken seriously. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of players recruited properly and hundreds and hundreds of programs that are clean.''\nSpeaking at the conference's annual basketball media day, Delany said ''an unsettling, negative narrative'' has been brought to light by the investigation. He also said the allegations are ''not shocking to me.''\n''I would say there's going to be three trials and every day there seems to be revelations,'' he added. ''Some of them are new and some of them have been heard before. But these were statements made under oath as a result of the FBI wiretaps of hundreds of hours if not more of thousands of conversations. Very negative.''\nFederal prosecutors have cast major college basketball as a corrupt enterprise where powerhouse programs and their high-profile coaches lean on athletic apparel giants to lure top prospects with cash payments to their struggling families. They argue that when top high school star Brian Bowen Jr. announced in June 2017 he would attend Louisville, he did it because of a payoff to his father.\nStory Continues Former sports agent Christian Dawkins, former Amateur Athletic Union coach Merl Code and former Adidas executive James Gatto have all pleaded not guilty to charges they plotted to pay Bowen's father in exchange for his son's promise to commit to Louisville.\nIt is the first trial related to an FBI investigation that exposed the sleazy side of big money in college basketball and led to charges against multiple people involved in making payments to student athletes. Other defendants, including former assistant coaches from Arizona, Auburn, the University of Southern California and Oklahoma State, face separate trials.\n''It's sad for college basketball and college sports,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said.\nIzzo's program was mentioned in the trial, though not in a negative light. Dawkins' defense attorney Steve Haney said Michigan State was one of the only schools that would not have paid Bowen to attend, according to the Arizona Daily Star.\n''I don't feel vindicated, because you shouldn't be commended for doing what you're supposed to do,'' Izzo said. ''We didn't do anything any different; just about every program that I know here does it the same way and I take my hat off to all the Big Ten coaches. It's not healthy for our organization. It's not healthy for college basketball. It's not healthy for college sports, and hopefully, something will come of it.''\nMaryland coach Mark Turgeon said he doesn't think the trial will have a major impact on the sport. He said college basketball is ''in great shape.''\n''I think we have great depth throughout college basketball,'' he said. ''It continues to grow. I think we have great coaching in our game. I think we have some really great teams this year, three, four, five teams that are terrific teams.''\nDelany said the issues are nothing new to college sports. But betters systems can be put in place to prevent them.\nHe said coaches can be better educated and that relationships with companies can be forged that don't create conflicts of interest.\n''There always have been these issues,'' Delany said. ''They used to involve boosters, third parties, shoe companies, commercial interests of one kind or another, agents and runners. I think there has to be a recognition that our approach can't be the same approach we took in the '80s. I don't think the colleges and the NCAA will ever get the kinds of governmental authority that it takes to break a conspiracy of silence or conspiracy of hiding their approach.''\nPRESEASON PICKS\nPurdue guard Carsen Edwards was voted the Big Ten preseason player of the year and a unanimous selection to the all-conference team. Edwards averaged 18.5 points and made 97 3-pointers - second-most in school history - as a sophomore last season while helping the Boilermakers reach the Sweet 16.\nWisconsin forward Ethan Happ was also a unanimous pick. Indiana guard Romeo Langford and forward Juwan Morgan, Maryland guard Anthony Cowan Jr., Michigan guard Charles Matthews, Michigan State forward Nick Ward and guard Cassius Winston, Minnesota senior forward Jordan Murphy and Nebraska senior forward James Palmer Jr. were also selected.\nThe Big Ten doesn't have a preseason poll for order of finish in the conference, but it does choose a preseason player of the year, as voted by the media.\n---\nMore AP college basketball: http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YYMzeJiJQgBF.G1ZSzTWlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwMjQ7aD03ODQ-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gJ52feqw3Qax2UBHEiojVg--~B/aD0zOTI7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201810110900324393590", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jYTNGSwfUlBo5XGJtRIrIw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQ5MC4wMjUwNjI2NTY2NDE2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/syNbdz6zGkYrZEyFfWtU0g--~B/aD0zMDU1O3c9Mzk5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201810110900324393590", "http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew seligman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "edwards", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anthony cowan jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cassius winston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james palmer jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romeo langford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juwan morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carsen edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan happ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles matthews", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "purdue", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boilermakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ill.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T17:35:47.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56741984efe7d60d1349b0645b62f921d2103d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WYlsneG0Aor9NUO.p7vwuAaf7F1jPtUxldP80zwDo.Ga7Bj8P1ss9Iyo41GWxB4eu", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "A.J.

Rob Bagchi Manchester United, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, the world's four richest clubs, are each enduring their worst starts to the season for a number of years More We could call it \u2018the curse of Forbes\u2019 if the problems of the four \u201cmost valuable soccer teams in the world\u201d were not piffling compared with all but a handful of other clubs. Back in June, when the plutocrats\u2019 bible announced that Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich remained exclusive members a clique worth more than \u00a32bn, it would not have envisaged that by the first week of October each of them would have the word \u201ccrisis\u201d attached to them in some degree or other, albeit in most instances hysterically. READ MORE: Carvajal - Neymar said he\u2019d sign for Real Madrid Given that Manchester United despite three defeats are only seven points behind Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid one and two points respectively short of Sevilla and Bayern Munich four off Borussia Dortmund, these are not so much \u2018first world problems\u2019 as minor inconveniences to the superyacht class, a tiny splinter of exquisite Malabar teak in the sole from promenading the deck moored off Portofino. Manchester United\u2019s flaws are more ingrained than the other three imperial giants and they are further behind their domestic and continental rivals but they do share common characteristics, principally a failure to invest in defenders that has exposed all the failings of their veterans. Barcelona, the one club that did buy a new centre-half, Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet, inexplicably dropped him after his impressive performance against Spurs and replaced him with Thomas Vermaelen for the match against Valencia. The former Arsenal captain was making only his 27th league appearance in his fourth season at Camp Nou in a career blighted by injuries for the past eight years and his last start came in the defeat by bottom of the table Leganes in September. Once again he made an error, compounded by Gerard Pique\u2019s maverick judgment, and Barcelona were 1-0 down within two minutes. Lionel Messi rescued them again but the inconsistency and unreliability of the defence in Samuel Umtiti\u2019s absence forces them to conquer their own failings as well as the opposition. Thomas Vermaelen battles Valencia's Michy Batshuayi More At Real Madrid Sergio Ramos\u2019s impetuosity was evident in the 3-0 defeat by Sevilla and the 1-0 loss at Alaves, the full-backs Dani Carvajal and Marcelo are injured and the left-back playmaker\u2019s absence has left them unbalanced and tetchy, like a swan with a broken wing. A squad is a coalition of personalities and factions, none more so than the European champions\u2019. Marcelo is their mood enhancer and energiser and his absence was particularly noticeable in their flaccid 1-0 defeat by CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. Story Continues Bayern Munich\u2019s World Cup-winning centre-back, Mats Hummels, is betraying his chronic lack of pace and Jerome Boateng\u2019s brittleness over the past four seasons (which makes Jose Mourinho\u2019s reported desire for Manchester United to bid \u00a350m for him irrational) leaves them vulnerable. Niklas S\u00fcle has eclipsed them both and is now de facto first-choice but it would be worth repeating Jupp Heynckes\u2019 experiment from last season against Hannover and play him as a defensive midfielder. It\u2019s not a long-term solution for their new manager, Niko Kovac, but he doesn\u2019t have the luxury of that perspective right now because Javi Mart\u00ednez has lost form and zip and Thiago Alcantara looks as stilted and doubtful in the role as his compatriot Cesc Fabregas was at Chelsea. Manchester United\u2019s defensive deficiencies have been well chronicled and it is plain to see that each player they have tried in the centre over the past couple of seasons - Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo, Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof - have ineradicable inadequacies that are revealed over time. They also have glaring weaknesses at full-back, having never recovered from Louis van Gaal\u2019s ditching of players with defence-first instincts to deploying converted wingers or promising gallopers such as Luke Shaw who never seems properly switched on when facing up to runners rather than chasing them down. Luke Shaw injury could lead to England call-up for Ben Chilwell More Inconsistency breeds rotation and every one of the four has been rattling through the changes. It\u2019s easy enough to blame a World Cup hangover for this but instead it is more driven by a search for fluency. Barcelona, for example, bought Philippe Coutinho specifically to play the Andres Iniesta role but the purchase of Arthur, a rhythmic passer and space invader who is inspiring tiki-taka revivalists to greet him as the second coming of Xavi, means Coutinho having to play in the No11 position with Ivan Rakitic coming over from right to left to play behind him. Coutinho is a wonderful player yet Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, a proper wide forward who was as good as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 before his injury last season, now can\u2019t get into the starting XI despite his manifest growing confidence that he belongs in the company of Messi and co. It has also angered Arturo Vidal, a box-to-box trooper, bought as an upgrade on the forceful Paulinho who scored nine league goals last season, and has been stuck on the bench. Last week at Wembley, his response to not making the starting XI was to tweet an enraged emoji. He is not usually so figurative in his expressions and, amusingly, a man who literally has \u2018never give up\u2019 tattooed across his adam\u2019s apple appears to be in a monumental strop about it. READ MORE: Juve rule out move to re-sign Paul Pogba Julen Lopetegui, the man who jeopardised the goodwill of the whole nation by taking the Real Madrid job while Spain manager and had such a tin ear that he was surprised by being sacked on the threshold of the World Cup, has also rung the changes. Not only is he rotating his goalkeepers Thibaut Courtois and Keylor Navas between competitions in a doomed attempt to placate the latter, he has also used Luca Modric and Casemiro from the bench. Dani Ceballos has been used in midfield, Marco Asensio has been given the impossible job of starting in Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s position and Isco, who had to have his appendix out a fortnight ago, has left a creative void that cannot be plugged by efficiency. Real, flaky on their journey to Kiev last season, never lacked exuberance when it clicked. This season they look joyless, a sin that Florentino P\u00e9rez who needs the team to swagger to sustain his financial high-wire act, cannot countenance for long. Marcos Asensio has the unenviable task of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo More Bayern Munich\u2019s first instinct last spring was to lobby Jupp Heynckes to stay on and only turned to Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Kovac when the 73-year-old caretaker turned them down after winning his fourth Bundesliga title. He has tried to mitigate the impact of ageing on once key players - particularly the \u2018Robbery\u2019 wing twins and to a certain extent Thomas Muller - by switching to a 4-1-4-1 but hasn\u2019t found the right midfield combinations. His bosses let Vidal depart for Barcelona, sold Sebastian Rudy and signed just Leon Goretzka on a free, bargaining that the return from loan spells of Serge Gnabry and Renato Sanches was adequate. Gnabry has outplayed Franck Rib\u00e9ry when picked in his place, Goretzka shows signs of fulfilling his potential as the heir to Michael Ballack but needs to score more goals and there are glimmers of hope that Sanches is emerging from his rut. But Thiago Alcantara is too frequently overrun as the pivot and is wasted in that position, James Rodriguez has not been fully fit and injuries suffered by Kingsley Coman and Corentin Tolisso have reduced Kovac\u2019s stock of dynamic players. In La Liga Real Madrid have gone 409 minutes without scoring and are feeling the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo and his 311 goals in 292 appearances keenly. Even in his worst season he scored 25 league goals but more fundamentally the need to make the most of him changed the way that Karim Benzema played. The centre-forward left Ronaldo to do the explosive running while doing his hounding for him and making all those supporting and defence-distracting bursts. Benzema scored five times last season and already has four in eight games this, demonstrating that he can contribute more when he is not playing second foil. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Niko Kovac pose at the Oktoberfest the day after the 3-0 home defeat by 'Gladbach More Robert Lewandowski has scored three goals in six games for Bayern, his slowest start for six years. Unlike Benzema, who is exiled from the France national team, Lewandowski did play at the World Cup yet it was hardly a physically taxing experience for the wretched Poland. Romelu Lukaku, who did go deep into the tournament, has looked listless in recent weeks for Manchester United while Luis Suarez is enduring a similarly sluggish start as last season with three goals from eight league starts. By the time the international break ends Barcelona will have gone a month without a Liga victory but their \u2018problems\u2019 are the least pressing of the four clubs. Ernesto Valverde lacks charisma and his caution has drained some of the singular exhilaration of their play in the league. Their pinnacles - the attacking performance against Tottenham most notably - are still beyond the grasp of everyone else but the goals they conceded at Wembley, like the ones in the Champions League defeat by Roma last season, reveal the old worrying signs of fragility that Umtiti\u2019s return alone will not solve. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are bedding in new managers and beginning to realise that postponing rebuilding work for so long makes the consequences more dramatic when they all catch up with you at once. Both have powerful dressing rooms, run by \u2018Duques\u2019 and \u2018Herzogs\u2019, who are backing Lopetegui and Kovac for now but there is also the danger at clubs where boards defer to players with political clout that they can also hold new managers hostage and prevent them from making necessary changes. With Antonio Conte and even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger available, not to mention Heynckes\u2019s susceptibility to an appeal to his conscience by Uli Hoeness, pledges of sticking by their managers to \u2018the bitter end\u2019 are vacuous and easily demolished by results. Jose Mourinho may be more secure in his position than either of them but that\u2019s because his club is in a bigger mess. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at least have experienced executives in their playing and football planning departments, a semi-permanent civil service that controls the direction. They may all have centre-forwards who are relatively out of sorts, defences that are prone to error and are whirring through midfield combinations in a quest for coherence. But only Manchester United have had five years of turmoil in the league, three managers with distinct approaches who have each contributed to an alarmingly lopsided squad of dubious quality, a complete breakdown of trus and an executive board that has authority without guile or the gumption to employ it.

''But if there's a potential Game 5, we feel very confident that Clayton should be the guy taking the baseball.''\nBraves manager Brian Snitker said he might use Sean Newcomb and Kevin Gausman, the first two pitchers in Sunday night's Game 3 in a fifth game. Right-hander Anibal Sanchez would be another option.\nJulio Teheran , who opened the season as Atlanta's No. 1 starter, continues to be held in the bullpen for long relief. Teheran was 9-9 with a 3.94 ERA in the regular season. He shared the team lead with Foltynewicz by starting 31 games.\n''We had mulled over him making a start, and liked the matchups better with the other guys pretty much,'' Snitker said\nSnitker moved second baseman Ozzie Albies to the No. 2 spot in the batting order - the team's third option behind leadoff hitter Ronald Acuna Jr. in the last three games. Third baseman Johan Camargo hit second in the first two games, followed by Ender Inciarte in Game 3. .\nCamargo is hitting fifth and Inciarte is seventh in Monday's lineup.

Even Mission:Impossible star Tom Cruise would baulk at the task facing Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel after Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix.\nThe German's hopes of winning a fifth Formula One title this season moved away from slim and closer to non-existent at Suzuka.\nLewis Hamilton's pole-to-flag victory, the Briton's sixth win in seven races and ninth of the season, delivered another hammer blow to a rival whose challenge has swiftly self-destructed.\nVettel is now 67 points behind his Mercedes rival with four races -- worth a maximum 100 points -- to go.\nThe battle between the two four-times champions looks effectively over, even if there is still fighting talk from Maranello.\n\"I know that the situation looks impossible,\" Ferrari team boss Maurizio Arrivabene said on Sunday. \"But our job sometimes is to challenge the impossible.\n\"This is what we are going to do and we try to do for the future four races.\"\nIn fact, it could all be over in two weeks' time at the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, where a win with Vettel finishing lower than second is all Hamilton needs to seal the deal with three races to spare.\n\"You say nearly (done), so obviously there is still a chance,\" said Vettel, cutting a resigned figure as he spoke to reporters.\n\"At the last couple of races we made it a bit too easy for them but also credit to them as they executed well, which is the name of the game.\n\"We need to look after ourselves and do our bit the next couple of races and then we see.\"\nFerrari's campaign has unravelled spectacularly as the season has worn on, with what appeared set to be a titanic battle of two four-time champions instead turning into a one-horse race.\nMistakes from both Vettel and the Italian team, as well as strategy blunders such as a failed tyre gamble in qualifying at Suzuka, have cost them dear. Story Continues\nThey no longer have the fastest car, with Mercedes locking out the front row and finishing in one-two formation in the last two races.\nHamilton is also in the form of his life and has to be favourite for victory again in Austin, where he has won every race bar one since the Texan track joined the calendar in 2012.\nVettel's highest finish since his win in Belgium at the end of August has been third and he will need to win at least the next two, with Hamilton failing to score, for any miracle to look remotely possible.\nStill, neither Mercedes nor Hamilton are taking anything for granted.\n\"A DNF (non-finish) and the consequent bad result suddenly wipes off a large chunk of your points,\" said Mercedes boss Toto Wolff.\n\"I know from the probability standpoint it doesn't look likely, but this is motor racing.\n\"I've seen many black swans swimming across the pond in my life... that's why I'd rather wait until it's really done.\"\n(Editing by Alan Baldwin/Christian Radnedge) What to read next ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abhishek takle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vettel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hamilton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sebastian vettel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis hamilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurizio arrivabene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom cruise", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vettel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ferrari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzuka circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maranello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzuka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzuka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-09T08:34:17.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6471406f6e8c3a13c7084d80b1694335edd72778", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WsVLZo413RQQRdXjIYF6kaUGWMm4lQ6jbZC1YF14BlpI6RtwK7GHnIb4eJaCM5wI04I4rU7mBpJXVz702DeknIn4pReThcRen", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Odd path to playoffs: Kratz, Voit, Brasier take longer road", "title_full": "Odd path to playoffs: Kratz, Voit, Brasier take longer road", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SYk.PO2Fdr5o9Id3sn3ExA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xNzAwLjI2NjY2NjY2NjY2Njc-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TG4MRbupLJ2tl3zV3mngeA--~B/aD0zMDczO3c9MjMxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201810032147784675113", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6471406f6e8c3a13c7084d80b1694335edd72778", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WsVLZo413RQQRdXjIYF6kaUGWMm4lQ6jbZC1YF14BlpI6RtwK7GHnIb4eJaCM5wI04I4rU7mBpJXVz702DeknIn4pReThcRen", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Odd path to playoffs: Kratz, Voit, Brasier take longer road", "text": "Odd path to playoffs: Kratz, Voit, Brasier take longer road BEN WALKER (AP Baseball Writer) October 8, 2018, 11:10 PM GMT 1 / 5 Odd path to playoffs: Kratz, Voit, Brasier take longer road New York Yankees' Luke Voit reacts after connecting for a two-run RBI triple against the Oakland Athletics during the sixth inning of the American League wild-card playoff baseball game, Wednesday, Oct. 3, 2018, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\nOf course Erik Kratz kept hoping for a moment like this. That's why he stuck around, through a dozen big league organizations, a couple of cruel demotions in the minors, a bunch of near-misses in the World Series.\nAnd the time he accidentally shot himself in the hand with a nail gun.\n''I really feel like I've played my last game for the last 12 years because the game doesn't owe anybody anything,'' the Milwaukee catcher said. ''When you understand that, you appreciate these times more than anything else.''\nLuke Voit certainly never expected to hear crowds at Yankee Stadium chanting his name in October, especially when he was stuck at Triple-A for St. Louis in late July. Yet there he was, batting third as New York hosted Boston on Monday night.\nRyan Brasier 's path to these playoffs was unusual, too. The Red Sox reliever is a rookie - even though he made his major league debut in 2013.\nThis postseason is full of stars, including Christian Yelich , Jose Altuve and Mookie Betts . Ronald Acuna Jr. , Miguel Andujar and Walker Buehler are among the many talented newcomers.\nTo see them here, now, that's probably not a huge surprise.\nBut Kratz? Starring on this stage?\nStill scrapping at 38, he's a .211 career hitter in the bigs, the very definition of a veteran backup catcher. He's been in the system of all four AL teams that reached the Division Series this year, plus the Brewers .\nKratz was with Kansas City in the 2014 World Series, but never got off the bench. He came close in Game 7, lined up to enter if All-Star catcher Salvador Perez had been pulled for a pinch-runner.\nThe next year, he went 0 for 4 in the regular season for the Royals and was nowhere near the playoff roster. Even so, they rewarded him with a championship ring.\nIn 2016, Kratz batted .069 in 14 games for Houston.\n''I love Kratzy,'' Astros manager AJ Hinch said Monday. ''I've texted back and forth with him like I do a lot of our players or ex-players. I still remember him running out for intros and falling down to win a bet. I'll always remember that, and got to get the video of that.'' Story Continues\n''I remember Erik Kratz, when I told him he was off our team, he was a proud Astro, so I'm happy when guys succeed when they go elsewhere,'' he said.\nKratz was in the minors this June when the Yankees traded him to Milwaukee for a player to be named. He impressed the Brewers with his work regimen and knowledge, and produced enough to earn a spot in the playoffs.\nAgainst Colorado last week, he became the oldest position player to start in his postseason debut since Lave Cross for the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1905 World Series.\n''Lave Cross from Milwaukee, yeah, he was a really good third baseman. We played together in rookie ball,'' Kratz kidded.\n''It's something that is part of history, so maybe in 113 years, some dude is going to be like, Erik Kratz - is it Kratz? What is that?'' he said.\nNo joke: Kratz went 5 for 8 in the NL Division Series sweep of the Rockies, and his Milwaukee teammates started chanting ''MVP! MVP!'' at him in the bubbly-soaked clubhouse.\n''It's gone from an unsung season to kind of a front-and-center role right now,'' Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.\nDuring the series, Kratz reflected on his future in baseball. He realizes time is running out.\n''I haven't had a good enough career to retire. I'm just going to quit. I'll just be out. That's what's going to happen,'' he said.\nBrasier's trip to this postseason also took several turns. He seemed to be off to a good start as rookie with the Angels in 2013, putting together a 2.00 ERA in seven relief appearances.\nThat was before Tommy John surgery, more time in the minors and a detour to Japan. He signed with the Red Sox in spring training, returned to the majors shortly before the All-Star break and kept a spot in the Boston bullpen.\nHe's already made his presence known.\nIn Game 2 of the ALDS, the 31-year-old Brasier got into a verbal spat with Gary Sanchez, annoyed that the Yankees slugger kept stepping out of the batter's box. That came as he struck out Andrew McCutchen, Giancarlo Stanton and Sanchez in the same inning.\nAt 27, Voit's trek wasn't so winding. Rather, he was backed up in the minors for St. Louis behind star first baseman Matt Carpenter. The beefy Voit didn't exactly fit the physical profile of the athletic-minded Cardinals, either.\nDealt to the Yankees shortly before the July 31 trade deadline for Giovanny Gallegos and Chasen Shreve, Voit got off to a slow start and seemed to be a backup for Greg Bird, at best.\nBut then, his huge swing started clicking. He connected for 14 home runs down the stretch, hit a two-run triple in the AL wild-card win over Oakland and has two hits and two RBIs in two playoff games against Boston.\nIn a city known for fashion, Voit also has made his own style statement. He prefers to keep the top button on his jersey unfastened, with no T-shirt underneath.\n''Let the chest hair hang, baby,'' he said.

Ahead of May\u2019s FA Cup final, which Chelsea won in Antonio Conte\u2019s last match in charge, Hazard, who moved to London in July 2012, said: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for new players next season. I want good players because I want to win next season the Premier League.\u201d And after helping Belgium to third place at last summer\u2019s World Cup, before Maurizio Sarri was appointed Conte\u2019s replacement, Hazard hinted at wanting a change of scene. He said: \u201cIt might be time to discover something different. You know my preferred destination.\u201d Following Sunday\u2019s match with Southampton, the Belgian shared his daily quandary. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie today. Sometimes in my head, I wake up in the morning and think I want to go. Sometimes I think I want to stay.\u201d What is likely to happen next? It is stick or twist time for Hazard, who has no agent. The power sits with the player: stay or go. He says he is not about to agitate for a move to the Spanish capital, like Diego Costa or Thibaut Courtois before him. He knows Chelsea would be forced to sell him next summer, or risk losing him for nothing the following year, if no contract extension has been agreed. But with Real Madrid his preferred destination, meaning there would just one suitor, negotiations over any transfer fee could be lengthy. READ MORE: FA investigating claims of \u2018systematic corruption\u2019 in \u00a3600m Wembley deal Where would he fit in at Real Madrid? This might be an unrequited love affair for Hazard as there is no confirmation from the Spanish giants that they want him. There are also questions over what state Real are in, after a floundering start under Julen Lopetegui in the post-Cristiano Ronaldo era. There was summer talk of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe being their preferred \u2018Galactico\u2019 to build the team around; at 26 and 19, respectively, both Paris St Germain players are younger than Hazard. Would the Belgian be the focal point of the team? Can Hazard fulfil his ambitions at Chelsea? That depends if Hazard\u2019s Real desire ends, as that is his biggest desire. On the pitch, Sarri has already revived the winger, freeing the Belgian of defensive responsibilities which were required under Conte and Jose Mourinho before him. Chelsea have reaped the benefits so far. We have seen Hazard on form before, but he needs to produce consistently, season after season; not one season on, one season off.

Although he scored in the Champions League victory over Young Boys, it was the first time he had found the net in the Premier League since a clash with Burnley in January. Martial now has 25 league goals to his name since moving from Monaco in 2015, a figure that means United owe Monaco another \u00a37.7m, say The Mail. They paid \u00a338.5m for the Frenchman back in 2015, but the deal included three different causes that could mean the figure eventually climbs to \u00a361m. One of them was 25 league goals, another \u00a37.7m will be due if Martial reaches 25 caps for his country while he is still a United player \u2013 he has 17 currently \u2013 and the third \u00a37.7m would be due if Martial won the Ballon d\u2019Or. Despite his obvious talent, Martial\u2019s progress has slowed down since Mourinho took charge at Old Trafford in 2016. The duo\u2019s relationship reached boiling point in the summer when Mourinho claimed Martial had gone AWOL. He had actually travelled home to be with his wife for the birth of his child, but was still fined two weeks\u2019 wages. Anthony Martial\u2019s work-rate has been criticised by Jose Mourinho More If Mourinho remains in charge at United, Martial looks unlikely to stay. While United will want to recoup some of the fee they have paid, Monaco inserted a 50 per cent sell-on fee in the deal back in 2015, meaning they\u2019d be due a large chunk of anything that United received.

Ndombele\u2019s contract has been extended to 2023 and Manchester City are also thought to have him on their radar, after he was one of the stars of Lyon\u2019s unlikely victory at the Etihad in the first set of Champions League group games. But City also have Ruben Neves and Frenkie de Jong, of Wolves and Holland respectively, on their sights. Buy-back Jadon Sancho looks set to be a regular feature in gossip columns going forward More Yesterday\u2019s gossip column contained the story that Spurs, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea were keen on Sancho, but there is a catch. The England starlet left Man City last summer, rejecting a new deal and choosing to sign for Borussia Dortmund in a quest for first-team football. But the 18-year-old insists there are no hard feelings and City inserted a buy-back clause into the deal to sell him to Dortmund, according to the Manchester Evening News. That means if Dortmund accept an offer for the forward, City have first refusal and if they match that offer, Sancho may well head back to the Etihad Stadium. Waiting game Eden Hazard will either be at Chelsea or Real Madrid tomorrow More Eden Hazard\u2019s quotes after Chelsea\u2019s victory over Southampton saw the Belgian given plenty of praise. He said a move to Real Madrid his his dream, that he loves playing for Chelsea, that he couldn\u2019t lie and say he didn\u2019t want to play for Real, but also that he loves London. Basically Hazard knows as much about his future as we do. But this morning a The Telegraph say that Hazard is essentially waiting to see what Madrid do before deciding his Chelsea future. If they prepare to make a multi-million pound for him, then he\u2019ll be off. If they do not, he is keen to stay at Chelsea. That clears it up somewhat, but the uncertainty surrounding Hazard\u2019s future is still there. Not that it has stopped him so far this season.

Marwin Gonzalez and Yuli Gurriel scored on the play.(AP Photo/David Dermer)\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Carlos Correa is in pain.\nEvery swing and miss hurts, and on the bad days it can even be uncomfortable for the Houston Astros star shortstop to walk.\nCorrea often puts on a brave face but told The Associated Press how much this is affecting him as the Astros prepare to leave for Boston and the best-of-seven AL Championship Series that begins on Saturday.\n''You're a competitor so every time you step on the field you play it off like everything is fine,'' he said Wednesday. ''But obviously you're hurting.''\nCorrea returned from a six-week stint on the disabled list on Aug. 10 and declared that he was better. But he has struggled to regain his top form. He hit just .180 in the second half of the season and managed a single hit - a home run - in an ALDS, looking nothing like the player who made the All-Star team last season and was the 2015 rookie of the year.\nHe said it bothers him most at the plate, and it's been impossible to get back to how he felt before the injury.\n''Not only to find my swing, just to feel comfortable at the plate when I swing,'' he said. ''Because I know every time I swing and miss it's going to hurt. So, I try not to swing and miss and then I try to baby my swing and I don't swing as hard as I usually do or as quick as I usually do. So, it's definitely been tough.''\nCorrea said there's been a domino effect of pain in other areas, most notably in his obliques, as he tries to avoid doing things that make his back hurt.\nHe's receiving treatment ''24/7,'' but the pain remains. He's using a foam roller at home and been sporadically taking anti-inflammatories.\n''It's just a pain down in my lower back that doesn't let me move right,'' he said. ''When I bend over, when I rotate. Sometimes when I wake up and I walk in the morning, I know it's not going to be a good day.'' Story Continues\nHe's accepted that the aching likely will be with him until he gets an extended rest. He's trying not to let it weigh on him, but in private moments at home with his fiancee Daniella Rodriguez, he laments that he simply hasn't been himself this season.\n''When I go to sleep at night, I think about especially this year (how) I'm not performing the way I know I can perform, it's just been tough,'' he said. ''Sometimes I talk to Daniella and I'm like: 'There's nothing I can do about it. I'm hurting.' But I'm a competitor so you grind, you try to perform. But it's definitely ... been frustrating at times.''\nDespite his woes, Correa started all three games of the ALDS and continues to play stellar defense, something he takes pride in as he struggles at the plate. And though he was just 1 for 10 against the Indians, his one hit was a big one - a three-run homer in the clinching game - providing hope that maybe things are getting better.\n''I feel like I had really good at-bats in the series vs. Cleveland, just not getting lucky with the balls I hit hard,'' he said. ''But that one fell, and it gives me a lot of confidence going into this series.''\nManager AJ Hinch was asked if he's concerned about Correa.\n''Not now,'' he said. ''We (have) four days off. We get to press the reset button. You don't just get to press pause either way. We had some guys get six and seven hits in that series, but you have to start over again, new opponent. So, no it doesn't concern me.''\nCorrea is focused on keeping a positive attitude as he fights through this and is determined to do all he can to help the Astros repeat as champions.\n''It's been a tough year. But it's not the end of the world,'' he said. ''I keep grinding every single day. I keep trying to find ways to help my team. I thought my defense this year was excellent and I'm looking forward to winning another championship and getting some rest.''\n''And come back next year strong and be the player that I am,'' he continued.\n---\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports What to Read Next ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "houston ss correa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rieken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "correa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carlos correa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yuli gurriel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marwin gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dermer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "houston ss correa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland indians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston astros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T09:23:23.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c5efdf6a7601e0710d56c623ce887c9014fc8df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT8e_qqbY8ZsjrPXiVXM.eSw6llmym6LoVXjBIVs2H_HGVjo1Coeajs1UOoQ0fMnKqHsOfVgImRHhNbt0Fwfjx9100TSeQHLWA-", "site_full": "uk.sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Vidal warned to show more respect by Barcelona director", "title_full": "Vidal warned to show more respect by Barcelona director", "published": "2018-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cEUukDUdEblQtWSMNOn3xw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/a1febdc59f7af1cc2f10aa9863a37f3b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c5efdf6a7601e0710d56c623ce887c9014fc8df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT8e_qqbY8ZsjrPXiVXM.eSw6llmym6LoVXjBIVs2H_HGVjo1Coeajs1UOoQ0fMnKqHsOfVgImRHhNbt0Fwfjx9100TSeQHLWA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vidal warned to show more respect by Barcelona director", "text": "Arturo Vidal's frustrated outbursts on social media have prompted a warning from Barcelona director Pep Segura. More Barcelona sporting director Pep Segura has told Arturo Vidal to show more respect to his team-mates and coach Ernesto Valverde after attracting criticism for social media posts. The Chile international joined Barca in a deal thought to be worth \u20ac20million in August after a successful spell in Germany with Bayern Munich, but things have not gone to plan in LaLiga. Only two of Vidal's six league appearances have been from the start, while he drew attention to himself by posting an angry emoji on his Instagram story after Barca's 4-2 Champions League win at Tottenham, a match in which he featured as a late substitute. He then posted \u2013 and deleted \u2013 a message saying \"don't fight with those who are like Judas, they will hang themselves\" after being an unused substitute in Sunday's draw away to Valencia, though he insisted it was nothing to do with football. Segura understands Vidal's frustration comes from a desire to do well for the club, but he thinks the 31-year-old should show greater professionalism. \"In general, the situation with Vidal is very clear,\" Segura told Sport. \"Firstly, with his protests, it's a clear demonstration that he wants to play for and serve Barcelona, contributing to winning everything, as he said when he was presented. \"The negative part is he doesn't have the delicate touch that a professional should have, out of respect for his coach and his team-mates. \"In a club as big as Barca, with the great professionals here, Vidal knows he has done wrong, that he lacked respect for his team-mates and I'm sure he will correct that.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arturo vidal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vidal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "judas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep segura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernesto valverde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "segura", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bayern munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valencia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T23:11:59.077+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d611ef804087aa32cbd7232e1108d7f0caee6254", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W1zTVjtMNbcRXZGmGmub8YfEuiQtqrGuem4vHNU7BUqNIHKkCaqZJTqp3F4BS1ggmViiO_GzvSiY-", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why McGregor, Dana White's Emphasis on Promotion Forced Many Fighters to Abandon UFC [Video]", "title_full": "Why McGregor, Dana White's Emphasis on Promotion Forced Many Fighters to Abandon UFC [Video]", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CkBP0O2x2tzXJohehbwhEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0ezZaXywkChNjXtcRRRnZw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/meredith_videos_131/aed8836026bb1e30f50e8def5ae78d0a", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 1, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d611ef804087aa32cbd7232e1108d7f0caee6254", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W1zTVjtMNbcRXZGmGmub8YfEuiQtqrGuem4vHNU7BUqNIHKkCaqZJTqp3F4BS1ggmViiO_GzvSiY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why McGregor, Dana White's Emphasis on Promotion Forced Many Fighters to Abandon UFC [Video]", "text": "Meredith Videos October 8, 2018, 4:02 PM GMT\nIs Conor McGregor bad for the UFC?

Newcastle scored twice in 10 minutes at Old Trafford, before conceding three in the final 20 minutes. More Rather than press home their early advantage Rafa Benitez\u2019s defensive ethos took charge. Newcastle sat back, invited pressure and inevitably wilted as United became more desperate. What little chances the Magpies could create they couldn\u2019t finish off. The missed chances could be put down to bad luck but it\u2019s just a continuation of a theme and that\u2019s why they find themselves winless with only two points and six goals scored. Things need to improve quickly; player confidence and fan unrest is already beginning to turn against the club and Benitez. The Spaniard is still idolised by the Toon faithful but cracks are beginning to appear . Benitez knows more than anyone, that results are what is important, no matter any mitigating factors. There are mitigating factors of course. Mike Ashley\u2019s ownership of the club is a long-running gripe for anyone involved the the club, and Newcastle have had by the far toughest start of any team in the Premier League. They\u2019ve already faced five of last season\u2019s top six in their opening eight matches and only lost each by an odd goal. The upshot is they now don\u2019t face any of the \u2018big six\u2019 until Boxing Day; a long run of infinitely more winnable matches which Benitez will hope he can use to safely guide his side away from the drop zone. But the results won\u2019t improve just because the opposition is easier; Newcastle have failed to beat \u2013 or even score against \u2013 Cardiff, Crystal Palace and Leicester already this season. Benitez needs to ensure Newcastle carry a larger goal threat if they are to start winning matches. And this is why Saturday\u2019s loss feels like it could be a defining moment even this early in their season. READ MORE: What can John Terry bring to Aston Villa as coach? The club needs to use the international break to hit the re-set button and get the fans back behind the team. Benitez needs to release the handbrake and his players must lift their standards or accept they\u2019ll be thrown into a relegation scrap. If they don\u2019t, it is easy to imagine Saturday as setting the narrative for Newcastle: A club unsure how to win a match, playing an attritional brand of football with a defence not quite capable enough to keep cleansheets against good teams and an attack unable to score goals against even teams with even the slightest hint of organisation. Fail to beat Brighton at home in their next match and it could be a very long season indeed.

But the letter of the rule hasn\u2019t changed, and Patriots coach Bill Belichick says that means his team hasn\u2019t changed the way it rushes opposing quarterbacks.\nAsked on a conference call about \u201cnew rules\u201d on roughing the passer, Belichick corrected the reporter.\n\u201c They\u2019re not new rules ,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not allowed to lead with your head, you\u2019re not allowed to body slam the quarterback, you\u2019re not allowed to hit him below the knees, you\u2019re not allowed to hit him above the shoulders. And, if he\u2019s out of the pocket, then some of those rules change, and if he\u2019s in the pocket, you\u2019re allowed to horse collar him. I mean, the rules are the rules. So, I mean, I hope you\u2019re not implying that we\u2019ve been coaching something that was illegal and now we\u2019re changing the way we\u2019re coaching it, because that\u2019s simply not the case. So, I\u2019m not really sure what new rule it is you\u2019re talking about here. We\u2019ve coached the rules as they\u2019ve been written and as we\u2019ve received them. So, whatever the emphasis is the emphasis is, but that doesn\u2019t change the fundamental of the rule. I\u2019ve never taught anybody to hit a quarterback above the shoulders or hit him below the knees or body slam him or lead with our helmet and spear him \u2013 like we\u2019ve never taught that. So, I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re referring to.\u201d\nThe Patriots haven\u2019t been flagged for roughing the passer at all this season, so whatever Belichick is doing to teach his players to avoid flags, it\u2019s working.

More Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba harbours no ambition to be captain of France and thinks he can be an influence for club and country regardless of whether he wears the armband or not. Jose Mourinho last month stripped Pogba of the United vice-captaincy amid reports of frosty relations between the two during the Red Devils' difficult start to the 2018-19 season. Having left Manchester to join the France squad for Les Bleus' forthcoming friendly against Iceland and Nations League encounter with Germany, the 25-year-old refuted an interest in being the national team's skipper. Pogba said in quotes reported by L'Equipe: \"I have never played for France to be captain. Being here is already something big for me.

A leader is not someone who has the armband on. \"As a leader you can talk on the pitch, but I have seen leaders who do not necessarily speak. \"For example, [Pogba's former Juventus team-mate Andrea] Pirlo is a leader, but he will not speak a lot in the dressing room. He will be there on the pitch and show you the way. He is a true leader. \"The armband has never been a goal.\" Pogba received criticism for publicly calling for United to play more attacking football, although France coach Didier Deschamps claimed the midfielder's falling out with Mourinho had been \"exaggerated\". While he would not be drawn on his relationship with the United boss, Pogba revealed Deschamps gave him advice on how to handle the intense media attention he faces. \"He [Deschamps] gave me good advice not to block this relationship that you have with journalists, the world, the fans,\" he said. \"Because otherwise you can have this image, 'Ah, he does not want to talk because he's upset,' when you are not at all. \"The coach spoke to me, he helped me with that. And now I think I'm a little more open, I express myself a little more. \"I've never been upset with journalists, it's just that I did not want to talk.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\nLONDON (AP) -- Male sports fans make up more than half of the group of people with an interest in women's sports, according to a report published Thursday by analysts Nielsen Sports.\nThe report found that 84 percent of general sports fans in eight key markets around the world, including the United States and Britain, have an interest in women's sports, and that 51 percent of those are male.\n''This research not only illustrates the vast amount of people actively interested in women's sports today, but also shines a spotlight on the significant commercial opportunities on the horizon,'' said Lynsey Douglas, who led the team behind the 32-page report ''The Rise of Women's Sports.''\n''From equal pay to record audiences and new media deals, women's sport is one of the fastest changing areas in the sports industry, and is more important now than ever before.''\nThe landscape for women's team sports has changed dramatically over the past few years, creating the potential to increase the cost of broadcasting rights and the pay of the athletes themselves. While tennis and golf have led the way for decades in the professionalization and commercialization of women's sports, their counterparts in team sports have lagged far behind despite some exceptions, such as with soccer in the United States.\nThat's all changing though, particularly in soccer, with leagues around the world being established. The Women's European Championship in 2017, for example, attracted a television audience of 150 million, according to Nielsen.\n''Building on this momentum, next year's Women's World Cup is set to engage on a large scale and represents a great platform for brands to stand out,'' Douglas said.\nNielsen found that of those people aware of next year's eighth Women's World Cup in France, 34 percent have already shown an interest. That's not far off the 45 percent equivalent for this year's men's version in Russia, which was eventually won by France. Story Continues\nWith promotional campaigns still to come, Douglas said there is a ''clear chance'' to engage potential fans ahead of the tournament, which will be broadcast around the world. Major broadcasters, such as the BBC in Britain, TFI in France and Fox in the United States, will show extensive coverage of the competition.\nNielsen's research in the eight countries - Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and the United States - involved 1,000 interviews per market, split between men and women between the ages of 16 and 69.\n---\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports What to Read Next ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dunn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crystal dunn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "north carolina courage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national womens soccer league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nielsen sports", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T01:50:29.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87a3d7c780c682b9a66d3db581bf4bc879fa63fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT8e_qqbY8ZsjrPXiVXM.eSw6llmym6LoX6fgZxR1YMgSemTu7lP.CMn27v8A2WlEcqdC2Ot40BvR8tmuMahR7sc.8u7BTFpQA-", "site_full": "uk.sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Thierry Henry and Rui Faria deal double blow to Aston Villa by rejecting manager's job", "title_full": "Thierry Henry and Rui Faria deal double blow to Aston Villa by rejecting manager's job", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YSY1Lqfk7A.dm3NTpsUKSQ--~B/aD0zOTc7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/36edbfd8b1272cb24df6cc1cc8cfb01c", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87a3d7c780c682b9a66d3db581bf4bc879fa63fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT8e_qqbY8ZsjrPXiVXM.eSw6llmym6LoX6fgZxR1YMgSemTu7lP.CMn27v8A2WlEcqdC2Ot40BvR8tmuMahR7sc.8u7BTFpQA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Law", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Thierry Henry and Rui Faria deal double blow to Aston Villa by rejecting manager's job", "text": "Thierry Henry and Rui Faria deal double blow to Aston Villa by rejecting manager's job Matt Law Rui Faria had been in line for the Aston Villa job after Thierry Henry turned the club down - getty images More Aston Villa have suffered a double blow in their hunt for Steve Bruce\u2019s successor after Thierry Henry and Rui Faria both turned down the Championship club . That has given Villa supporter Dean Smith a huge boost in his bid to land his dream job, with the club set to try to speak to the Brentford manager. Henry informed Villa on Tuesday night that he would not be accepting their offer to take over from Bruce and then Faria ruled himself out of the race. READ MORE: Why Martial\u2019s goal against Newcastle cost United \u00a37.7m Villa reacted quickly to the double rejection by arranging talks with candidates further down their shortlist, including Smith. Sources in Portugal also claim Villa want to speak to Benfica B manager Bruno Lage, who was assistant to Carlos Carvalhal at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City. John Terry, who has also been touted as a potential successor to Bruce , remains in the frame for a coaching position under whoever is eventually appointed. John Terry is likely to be employed in some capacity More Candidates will not be instructed that they have to employ Terry, but it is being made clear that Villa would like him involved and the former Chelsea defender can expect to earn in the region of \u00a31million a year. Villa had hoped to announce Henry\u2019s arrival on Monday, but the Frenchman decided against starting his managerial career in the Midlands after being targeted by Monaco. Henry is part of a three-man shortlist to replace Leonardo Jardim at Monaco and that opened the door for Faria, who Villa were keen on. READ MORE: Conte, Zidane... Ranieri? 10 tempting out of work managers But it is understood Faria informed Villa he is not ready to return to football after leaving his job as Manchester United\u2019s assistant under Jose Mourinho at the end of the season. Faria\u2019s decision came as a major surprise and boosted Smith\u2019s bid to convince Villa he is the right man. Smith had been rated as an outsider for the post, but he has quickly moved up towards the top of Villa\u2019s shortlist since Bruce\u2019s sacking. He would be an appealing appointment to Villa fans, as he often attends the club\u2019s games with his family when he can find time away from Brentford. Smith enjoyed a successful four-year spell managing Walsall, before taking over at Brentford in 2015 and is used to working with a director of football which would suit Villa, who are expected to confirm their own appointment in the position shortly. Lage would represent an enormous gamble by Villa and would increase theories that super-agent Jorge Mendes is having a big input into the managerial process.

(AP) The Universities of North Carolina and South Carolina planned an exhibition basketball game between the two programs to raise money for recovery efforts after Hurricane Florence ravaged parts of the neighboring states.\nLast week, the NCAA shut it down .\nThe billion-dollar organization that justifies making its fortune on the backs of unpaid student-athletes decided that two schools raising money for residents in their back yards who are truly in need was out of bounds.\nTypcial NCAA nonsense The decision was absurd and insulting. And completely expected from the archaic institution being exposed and unraveled daily this week in a U.S. federal court .\nNorth Carolina head coach Roy Williams spoke publicly for the first time about the canceled game on Tuesday, and his reaction was as perplexed as the rest of us.\nRoy Williams \u2018dumbfounded\u2019 \u201cI was dumbfounded when the waiver was not granted,\u201d Williams told reporters in Chapel Hill, N.C., per the Charlotte Observer. \u201cOur state and South Carolina had a terrible tragedy, a horrific storm come through, whatever you want to call it. And I called (South Carolina head coach) Frank (Martin) to see if he would be interested in playing a game.\u201d\nDevastating flooding from Hurricane Florence ravaged communities in North Carolina and South Carolina. (AP) Martin was, and the two teams planned a game in Charlotte with the cooperation of Hornets owner and UNC alum Michael Jordan .\nNCAA protecting sanctity of exhibition games That was until the NCAA said no. The Charleston Post and Courier reported that the NCAA rejected a waiver request for the two schools to exceed their limit of two exhibition games a season.\nFrom the report:\nSchools are allowed two exhibition games per season, a public one and a \u201csecret\u201d scrimmage in a closed gym with no reports and no statistics released to the public. Coaches aren\u2019t even supposed to acknowledge the \u201csecret\u201d scrimmage\u2019s presence.\nStory Continues NCAA: Recruiting rules over humanitarian cause The rule is in place in part to prevent recruiting advantages for participating teams.\n\u201cSome rule had been put in that they weren\u2019t going to give waivers (because) we already had the other two games,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd guys, if you guys can convince me how that was going to help North Carolina\u2019s basketball team or South Carolina\u2019s basketball team over somebody else, then I\u2019ll listen to it. But that was not the intent.\n\u201cWhen you see the scenes of people\u2019s stuff out on the street, you want to do something. And that\u2019s sadly what we saw. We saw so many situations, people losing everything they have. And we had what I thought was one of the few good ideas I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nIt was a good idea. A good idea that could have helped people who were truly suffering.\nAnd the NCAA did one of the things it does best. It shot a good idea down. All in the name of protecting the \u201cintegrity\u201d of one of the most corrupt governing bodies in all of sports.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 NFL\u2019s TV ratings dip wasn\u2019t about Trump, study finds\n\u2022 Ex-Olympian Gold eyes return after battling mental illness\n\u2022 Yankees\u2019 Sabathia rips \u2018terrible\u2019 ump after ALDS loss\n\u2022 Dan Wetzel: Will new revelation get Louisville the death penalty?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2018/03/07/ncaa-billion-dollars/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r8HYTIM8TuGpDeI96P1dcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQyNi41ODQ2MTUzODQ2MTU0/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fPIg4Q5uQeu4z.SvvLFwsQ--~B/aD0xNzMzO3c9MjYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/185d63d8634d4dd805d322be1d3b1787", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1GPfcW_XOrkT7urzBK04hA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODguNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zFpfMcVqIUhdpEPD5e_1hQ--~B/aD0yNDQyO3c9MzUxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/20318f32fae8f886f281c36865b9eee7", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zohTy6HLwog_PJNKuxSwmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQ0NC41MDUxMTk0NTM5MjQ5/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zFpfMcVqIUhdpEPD5e_1hQ--~B/aD0yNDQyO3c9MzUxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/20318f32fae8f886f281c36865b9eee7", "https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/college/article219736165.html", "https://www.postandcourier.com/sports/ncaa-says-no-to-south-carolina-north-carolina-basketball-exhibition/article_e92e4d16-c8d6-11e8-99a1-a33c60585114.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy williams", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "typcial ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T08:08:18.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0b4c443a6fc8c2064ef496bc3764a59264e8b4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WmSYEc8cIKvg._9EwM7khhc.YYaBSrysosoAB.Mx98DYXnuFtDCQtRUkaxrBpd.Ejwc.b7V5E4js-", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jimmy Butler: I\u2019ll return to Timberwolves practice today, situation could be fixable, don\u2019t think it will be", "title_full": "Jimmy Butler: I\u2019ll return to Timberwolves practice today, situation could be fixable, don\u2019t think it will be", "published": "2018-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.049, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6suucjxDtDd20CKUpbMUiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8BlPhdcxoMmqhpiV1wo9qw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/5ed0b2f0eeac59f76d76f2725ccc6508", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0b4c443a6fc8c2064ef496bc3764a59264e8b4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WmSYEc8cIKvg._9EwM7khhc.YYaBSrysosoAB.Mx98DYXnuFtDCQtRUkaxrBpd.Ejwc.b7V5E4js-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jimmy Butler: I\u2019ll return to Timberwolves practice today, situation could be fixable, don\u2019t think it will be", "text": "Jimmy Butler: I\u2019ll return to Timberwolves practice today, situation could be fixable, don\u2019t think it will be Dan Feldman October 11, 2018, 7:36 PM GMT\nJimmy Butler proved several points at the Timberwolves \u2019 practice yesterday:\nHe can beat all of them at basketball.\nHe can talk trash to whomever he wants.\nHe can come and go as he pleases.\nDid Butler make his statement with finality? Not quite.\nButler, in a Q&A with Rachel Nichols on ESPN yesterday:\nNichols: \u201cSo, you were back in practice today.\u201d\nButler: \u201cI was.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cI assume you\u2019re going back tomorrow.\u201d\nButler: \u201cI am.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cShould people think, because you were back in practice, that this is fixed or it\u2019s on its way to being fixed?\u201d\nButler: \u201cI think people think that. I think people think that. I would think that, too.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cWhat do you think?\nButler: \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s not fixed. Let\u2019s just be honest. It\u2019s not fixed.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cIs it fixable?\u201d\nButler: \u201cIt could be. It could be. But do I think so? No. Because you\u2019ve got to be honest. I\u2019m being honest. Do I think so? No. I\u2019m being honest with you. But is everybody going to be honest? No.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cDid you, after the season ended, did you talk to Coach Thibs?\u201d\nButler: \u201cYes, I did.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cSo, when you guys talked, even over the phone after the season was over \u2013\u201d\nButler: \u201cHe knows how I felt.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cHow soon after the season did you tell him how you feel?\u201d\nButler: \u201cFour days.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cFour days after the season?\u201d\nButler: \u201cFour.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cHow clear were you?\u201d\nButler: \u201cHave you ever known me to hide anything?\u201d\nNichols: \u201cI\u2019m just asking.\u201d\nButler: \u201cLook what happened today at practice. Have you ever known me to hold back? No. I was completely honest about everything, about everything.\u201d\nNichols: \u201cAnd about what you wanted and where you wanted to be?\u201d\nButler: [nods]\nI appreciate Butler\u2019s straightforwardness and perspective.\nMaybe Butler should care more about how he affects others\u2019 feelings, but honesty is so important. As Butler said, he\u2019s not one to hide anything. That\u2019s clearly his response to questions about why he requested a trade just before training camp. From his perspective, he made it known much earlier he wanted to leave Minnesota. Story Continues\nThat said, opinions can change. It\u2019d be shortsighted to say he\u2019ll never want to play for the Timberwolves again. He believes he won\u2019t ever want to, but he\u2019s also wise enough to understand he might want to. Better to acknowledge the inherent uncertainty of life than pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.\nThe bigger question: Do the Timberwolves want him back? It\u2019ll partially depend what other teams offer , but how Minnesota feels internally also matters. Tom Thibodeau could see Butler\u2019s acknowledgment the situation could be fixable as a window to try to fix it.

She saw off Zagitova on her racecourse debut on Newmarket\u2019s July Course before landing the Group 3 Prestige Stakes at Goodwood, a race won last year by subsequent 1,000 Guineas winner Billesdon Brook. She took her time to get going at Goodwood, but this extra furlong should suit her and she should find more improvement for the experience. Odds: 3/1 BEYOND REASON (Charlie Appleby) Charlie Appleby grabbed a tenth Group 1 winner of the season when Wild Illusion won in France on Sunday and Beyond Reason looked like she would go to the very top when she pulled three lengths clear in the Group 2 Prix du Calvados at Deauville in August. However, she failed to follow up in Group 1 company when finishing sixth behind Skitter Scatter in the Moyglare Stud Stakes over 7f at the Curragh four weeks ago. The step up to a mile and faster ground will likely suit, and she is a big price for a dual Group-winning filly. Odds: 12/1 Hermosa on the way to winning her maiden Maiden at Galway in July More HERMOSA (Aidan O\u2019Brien) One of two runners from the Ballydoyle stable, Hermosa was in front of Beyond Reason when third in the Moyglare, and she subsequently franked that form by scoring in a Group 3 at Naas. She stayed on well in the Moyglare from a long way off the pace, suggesting she could become a nice middle-distance filly next season. Hermosa appears to have been crying out for further and should benefit from the extra furlong on the Rowley Mile. Odds: 7/2 IRIDESSA (Joseph O\u2019Brien) Iridessa is thought of quite highly by her young trainer. She won over 1m on her Killarney debut and was straight into Group 2 company for her second start, when beaten just over five lengths by subsequent Group 1 winner Skitter Scatter at the Curragh. She did not have a great draw last time in a Listed 7f race at Leopardstown, but finished off her race well and she deserves her chance in this. The extra distance should help. Odds: 25/1 LAYALEENA (Sir Michael Stoute) The daughter of Sea The Stars created a favourable impression when giving her trainer a rare debut-winning 2yo on the July Course, and she did it with some aplomb, despite gaining a head verdict from maiden Ice Gala. That form was franked, with three subsequent winners behind her, but she sadly ran no sort of race on the AW at Lingfield on her second start, so has a few questions to answer now. Odds: 14/1 Pretty Pollyanna won the Duchess Of Cambridge Stakes, but blotted her copybook last time More PRETTY POLLYANA (Michael Bell) The daughter of Oasis Dream is on something of a recovery mission herself. She was the ante-post QIPCO 1,000 Guineas favourite after following up a superb win in the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes with victory in the Prix Morny. However, her trainer looked visibly shocked in the unsaddling enclosure when she could finish only fourth as hot favourite for the Juddmonte Cheveley Park Stakes here less than a fortnight ago. Danny Tudhope replaces Silvestre de Sousa in the saddle this time. Bell was reluctant to blame De Sousa for the defeat, but he was a little concerned that she had been taken back during the race and it did not help her cause. The extra 2f is an unknown, because she has raced exclusively over 6f. Odds: 4/1 SHAMBOLIC (John Gosden) This daughter of Shamardal represents Arc-winning trainer-jockey combination of John Gosden and Frankie Dettori. She arrives unbeaten on the back of victories at Newmarket\u2019s July Course and at Ascot. She had the run of the race out in front at Ascot, which was run at a steady pace, but she had enough to see off the 93-rated favourite Model Guest in the dash to the line. She is going the right way but whether she has the class to win this is open to question. Odds: 7/1 ZAGITOVA (Aidan O\u2019Brien) Fourth in the Moyglare, this Galileo filly already has winning form over a mile, having scored in a Curragh maiden on her second of four starts. She would not have to improve much to win this and the step back up to 1m, in addition to the likely better ground than she encountered at the Curragh in the Moyglare, should see improvement forthcoming. Odds: 7/2 TRENDS TO NOTE Six of the last 12 winners were either favourite or joint-favourite Eight of the last 12 winners had won on their previous outing Five of the last 12 winners had at least one previous run at Newmarket Nine of the last 12 winners had at least one run over 1m 11 of the last 12 winners had at least three previous runs Eight of the last 12 winners had at least one previous Group-race victory Watch live Horse Racing action in your local Genting casino.

Liverpool Fabinho \u2013 It was surprising that Fabinho hadn\u2019t played before the last international break, but the \u00a343.7m is still a cup specialist for the Reds.

Diogo Dalot \u2013 The 19-year-old made his Manchester United debut in the Champions League, but is yet to feature in the Premier League. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing on recent form. Southampton Angus Gunn \u2013 Still consigned to the bench, but Alex McCarthy pulled out the England squad due to injury, so Gunn might get his chance after the international break. Watford Ben Wilmot \u2013 An 18-year-old who was wanted by Spurs and Arsenal, the former Stevenage player is one for the future, despite his Carabao Cup appearances. Domingos Quina \u2013 Another teenager signed for the future and limited to Carabao Cup appearances. Wolves Leander Dendoncker \u2013 The Belgian has been linked with multi-million pound moves to the Premier League for a while, but now he has arrived he can\u2019t get a game. Odd.

Gotta prepare for something like that. If, you know \u2026\u201d\n\u201cTwelve in a row,\u201d I say. \u201cYou believe, though, right?\u201d\nA deep laugh.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll have that.

Two others are at the counter at George Webb\u2019s, a burger joint on 3rd Street, a 24-hour diner that gives burgers away every three decades or so, assuming the Brewers win Friday\u2019s National League Championship Series opener against the Dodgers, which would give them 12 consecutive wins, which will satisfy old George\u2019s original marketing gimmick and have his joint feed the town, just like in \u201987, the last and only time the Brewers have banged out a dozen in a row. The smallish restaurant chain paid up with nearly 170,000 burgers that day or, as the T-shirts attest, \u201cBrewers 12, George Webb 168,194, April 19, 1987.\u201d Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 Mike Moustakas, left, congratulates Christian Yelich after Yelich scored on a ground ball hit by Travis Shaw against the Colorado Rockies in the first inning of Game 3 of a baseball National League Division Series, Sunday, Oct. 7, 2018, in Denver. (AP Photo/Joe Mahoney)\nSo I wait on my preview burger. The woman at the counter beside me says, \u201cHow\u2019s your day,\u201d and I say, \u201cFine except for it\u2019s raining and I have no umbrella,\u201d to which she grins and says, \u201cIt ain\u2019t that bad.\u201d And I agree.\nThe night before, in my quest to find Major Goolsby\u2019s, I\u2019d wandered the streets of downtown for an hour before finding the bar three blocks from my hotel. It was raining, a steaming rain, the kind when a drop hits your shoulder it sends up a little puff of smoke. But, the bartender, Kirby, America\u2019s personal bartender, had good stories (the large pig at the front door is named for Charles Barkley and the restroom is straight that way, take a right at the Harley, my kind of place) and a soft spot in his soul for the Brewers and the TV turned to whoever the Brewers would play in the World Series, should they get that far. They\u2019ve been before, once. Never won it, though. Maybe this year\u2019ll be different. Story Continues\nIt\u2019s still raining like that, but nobody seems to mind, and maybe that\u2019s because it rains like that a lot or because, hey, it\u2019s the middle of October and it\u2019s still baseball season. Four miles away, Miller Park from the highway looks like one of those new handbags they\u2019re carrying on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. Soon, they\u2019ll be stretching and taking BP and chasing fungoes, preparing for the biggest series in town since they\u2019d lost to the Cardinals at this same point seven years ago. Craig Counsell, the Brewers manager, was a player on that team.\nHe said he\u2019s never had a George Webb burger. He grew up here. In fact, I couldn\u2019t find a single player who\u2019d heard of the place, which was weird, given it\u2019s been around for 70 years (this year), or its feed-the-world pledge, though Jeremy Jeffress seemed game. \u201cYou got one?\u201d he asked, \u201d \u2019cause I\u2019ll try it.\u201d Alas.\nYet, I sit on a blue-ish stool, my elbows on a beige counter, game. In the spirit of the thing.\nThere are signs everywhere. Not the omens kind. Regular signs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fix or remake your food, but no refunds.\u201d\n\u201cRestrooms for customers only.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re hiring.\u201d\nWednesday is split pea and ham soup day.\nOne that says that from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. you have to pay upfront. The counter is very close to the door.\nA poster on the far wall: \u201cGeorge Webb predicts the Brew Crew will win 12 straight games.\u201d\nThere it is, the Brewers sitting on 11, me on a blue-ish stool.\nBeneath the breathy analysis of Dodgers-Brewers, the arched-brow breakdowns of this starting rotation and that bullpen, there\u2019s a city of 600,000 people and their ballclub with half the payroll of the big fellas, the sort of newcomer that makes October charming again. The sort of team that with a little luck could win this thing, all of this thing.\nAnd a burger. Maybe lots of them.\nIt arrives with little ceremony. With the bun, the pickles and the onions, the burger is mostly bun, pickles and onions. But, hey, in a week it\u2019ll be free. Not that we know that yet.\nThe burger goes pretty quickly. An older gentleman, meantime, has taken an interest in the younger woman beside me. He buys her coffee. He works his magic. She smiles kindly.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being finessed by an 80-year-old,\u201d she says, amused.\nWhen he\u2019s walked out the front door and she is still shaking her head I look at her and say, \u201cIt ain\u2019t that bad.\u201d And she agrees. She laughs.\nA moment later, the gentleman is back.\n\u201cI forgot my cane,\u201d he says.\nEveryone enjoys that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle!\u201d she says.\nFrom behind the counter, a deep laugh. Could be a busy week. Not that we know that yet.\nMore from Yahoo Sports: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-12T00:08:15.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb8feafdcbb38c3178f47ad609d060945e33b0c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WGCN2PprVoEqg6L4HBqrk8XZyZniLYz20N_qcCmgxdo5EioVA8vbsG6Xp4ZGfEv8guoAI9_wPk6iG1KJHMTWVpFhzPaO1lO.y", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Lightning top Panthers 2-1 in shootout; Luongo hurt", "title_full": "Lightning top Panthers 2-1 in shootout; Luongo hurt", "published": "2018-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jcKjY.NlLWO4sSVU_X0nMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTkwNDtoPTEwMjQ-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TtwGXX0j8dFNXn3Gbq0N9A--~B/aD01MTI7dz00NTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201810062058755129504", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb8feafdcbb38c3178f47ad609d060945e33b0c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WGCN2PprVoEqg6L4HBqrk8XZyZniLYz20N_qcCmgxdo5EioVA8vbsG6Xp4ZGfEv8guoAI9_wPk6iG1KJHMTWVpFhzPaO1lO.y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lightning top Panthers 2-1 in shootout; Luongo hurt", "text": "Lightning top Panthers 2-1 in shootout; Luongo hurt MARK DIDTLER (Associated Press) October 7, 2018, 2:53 AM GMT 1 / 10 Lightning top Panthers 2-1 in shootout; Luongo hurt Tampa Bay Lightning left wing Alex Killorn (17), center Anthony Cirelli (71), and defenseman Anton Stralman (6) celebrate Cirelli's goal during the third period of an NHL hockey game Saturday, Oct. 6, 2018, in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Jason Behnken)\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Panthers not only lost their season opener, they lost goalie Roberto Luongo , too.\nJ.T Miller and Nikita Kucherov scored in the shootout and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Panthers 2-1 in the regular-season opener for both teams Saturday night.\nLuongo departed midway through the second period with a lower-body injury after teammate Frank Vatrano landed on his extended right leg during a scramble in front of the goal. The 39-year-old Luongo, who stopped all 13 shots he faced in just over 32 minutes, needed help to skate off the ice.\n''He had some ice on his knee,'' Panthers coach Bob Boughner said. ''I don't know how serious (the injury is). Hopefully that's not going to be a long-term thing. They're going to reassess it and I'll know more tomorrow.''\nJames Reimer replaced Luongo and stopped 15 shots.\n''He's a battler and he's a workhorse,'' Reimer said. ''Obviously you saw the position he was in when someone fell on him and you could just tell that it wasn't an injury you could stay in the game.''\nLuongo was also shaken up earlier in the second when he took a shot by Steven Stamkos off the mask.\nLightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy made 42 saves in regulation. He made one save in the shootout and had another shot hit the post.\n''They're not all going to be pretty, but we'll take it and we'll move on,'' Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said.\nThe Lightning got a third-period, short-handed goal from Anthony Cirelli.\nTampa Bay was held scoreless over the final 159:27 in the 2018 Eastern Conference Final in which eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington rebounded from a one-game deficit to win Games 6 and 7.\nJacob MacDonald scored for the Panthers. Florida missed the playoffs by one point last season despite going 25-8-2 after the All-Star break.\nCirelli tied it at 1 by beating Reimer with 9:15 to play. Story Continues\nMacDonald scored at 5:58 of the first from the left circle on his first shift and shot in his first NHL game. The 25-year-old MacDonald is the sixth NHL player born in Oregon.\n''That's obviously your dream, to go out there and have a shift like that,'' MacDonald said.\nFlorida center Derek MacKenzie left in the first period with an upper-body injury.\nNOTES: Kucherov, who had 39 goals and 100 points last season, didn't have a shot on goal during regulation. . Lightning F Ryan Callahan (shoulder surgery) is starting the season on injured reserve, but could be back in the next month. C Tyler Johnson (upper body) didn't play, but should return next week. ... Panthers D MacKenzie Weegar (shoulder) sat out, while D Bogdan Kiselevich (jaw), LW Jamie McGinn (back) and D Josh Brown (upper body) are on IR.\nUP NEXT\nPanthers: Will honor the inaugural 1993-94 team as part of their 25th-year celebration before Thursday night's home opener with Columbus.\nLightning: Play the second of a season-opening five-game homestand Thursday night against Vancouver.

He has plenty of success at chasing titles, and either this season or next, the club\u2019s owners will be expecting to mount a successful promotion challenge. Automatically or via the playoffs, Terry has been through his share of triumphs, and that should be able to help guide the squad through some stressful times. Perhaps least importantly, for now, is that Terry brings his fame. Villa\u2019s new owners will be keen to take a Championship Villa and rekindle it as an established Premier League big name, a move which would increase the value of their asset by tens of millions, if not multiples more. Terry, like Thierry Henry, would be able to attract players who might not normally drop down a division, or play without European football. Jorge Mendes showed a similar influence at Wolves to get them ready for life in the Premier League. He also understands how to build resilience. Terry has gone through his share of disappointments, not limited to: being banned for racist language, being stripped of the England captaincy, allegations he facilitated tours of Wembley and Chelsea\u2019s training ground in return for cash, missing a penalty in a Champions League final, the Wayne Bridge episode, and Craig Bellamy dressing him down on television. He has emerged from these episodes still able to play football at the highest level. Whether he was sufficiently punished for them is another question. For the Villa squad, he may be able to impart in them a desire to come through whatever tribulations they might experience. And, ideally, not to bring such pressures on themselves in the first place. Terry was at Villa last season, and bringing him into the coaching staff could ease Henry\u2019s integration, should he be appointed. He could be \u2013 and this a double-edged sword \u2013 a mentor to promising players like Jack Grealish.

Rob Dauster NBC Sports October 10, 2018, 9:43 PM GMT During the 2018-19 college basketball season, we will be taking deeper dives into the betting markets now that sports gambling has been legalized outside of the state of Nevada.\nTo kick the season off, we are going to break down National Title futures and which bets are worth your time and money.\nHere are the five teams with odds 50:1 or lower that are the easiest to fade during the preseason.\nREMINDER: A bet of $100 on +200 odds would win $200. A bet of $100 on +10,000 odds would win $10,000. A bet of $1 on +20,000 would win $200.\nNOTE: These odds come via the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook.\nMICHIGAN (+3,000) Michigan has a chance to be a pretty good team this year. They finished last season as the No. 3 team in KenPom\u2019s adjusted defensive efficiency metric, and with all of their best defenders \u2014 and defensive coordinator Luke Yaklich \u2014 all back, I fully expect them to once again be among the nation\u2019s-best defensive teams.\nAnd that\u2019s before you factor in John Beilein, who has proven himself to be one of college basketball\u2019s best coaches and ruthlessly effective in tournament settings. He\u2019s been to the national title game twice. He\u2019s won back-to-back Big Ten tournaments. Who can forget the success he had with West Virginia.\nSo I get it.\nI\u2019m just not willing to pay this price.\nFor starters, the Wolverines are going to enter the season ranked somewhere near the back-end of the top 25 \u2014 we have them 23rd \u2014 but there are just nine teams with lower odds to win the national title. That\u2019s a red flag.\nThen you have to factor in the issues I expect the Wolverines to have on the offensive end of the floor. There were long stretches of last season where Michigan\u2019s offense was painful to watch, and this offseason they parted ways with their three-best offensive weapons \u2014 Mo Wagner, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman and Duncan Robinson. That means that they are going to have to be carried offensively by players that have either failed to provide they can handle that kind of load (Zavier Simpson, Charles Matthews ) or by youngsters that haven\u2019t proven themselves at this level yet ( Jordan Poole , Isaiah Livers ).\nStory Continues While it is important to be a good defensive team if you want to have success in March, you are much more likely to make a Final Four or national title run with an elite offense and a good-enough-defense than vice versa. I did a study on this subject. You can see the results here and here .\nSo I would stay away from Michigan, particularly at these odds.\nRELATED: The longshot national title futures with value UCLA (+3,000) Even before the injuries that ravaged their bench, the Bruins were a team that I had no interest in . This is a program that has played precisely zero defense in the Steve Alford era, and they are entering a season where their three best players aren\u2019t exactly know for their effort on the defensive end of the floor and where issues may arise over whose team this is, Kris Wilkes or Jaylen Hands.\nThat was before we found out that Alex Olesinki had injured his foot and will miss at least a couple of months, Shareef O\u2019Neal will miss the season due to a previously-undiagnosed heart ailment and Tyger Campbell \u2014 the one steadying presence that the Bruins had in their backcourt \u2014 had torn his ACL.\nI expect the odds here to adjust eventually, but as it currently stands, betting on UCLA to win a national title when they have the tenth-lowest odds is giving money away. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to do, I\u2019ll send you my Venmo. Your money will be put to better use that way.\nOREGON (+2,000) According to the Westgate\u2019s oddsmakers, Oregon is the seventh-most likely team in college basketball to win the national title.\nSeventh!\nI\u2019m a fan of Dana Altman and I think that this Oregon team does have some talent \u2014 they should be one of the two-best teams in the Pac-12 this season \u2014 but seventh?\nThat is a steep price to pay for a team that undeniably has flaws.\nThis is one of the youngest teams that Altman will have coached at Oregon. As much respect as I respect Payton Pritchard, he\u2019s not exactly the kind of lead guard that Altman has thrived with in the past, and neither are Altman\u2019s wings; Louis King might be able to fill that Dillon Brooks\u2019 role, but that is a big ask from a freshman.\nThat\u2019s not the biggest issue I have, however.\nThe reason that Oregon is regarded this highly likely has to do with the fact that they landed Bol Bol, a top five recruit in the class and a potential top ten pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. But I have real concerns over his effectiveness at the college level \u2014 both due to who he is as a player and his fit in the Oregon system. There\u2019s a lot to unpack there (I go through it all in detail here ) but it should be enough to scare you off the Ducks when the payoff you\u2019re getting is only 20:1.\nINDIANA (+4,000) I actually like this Indiana team this season. Romeo Langford will likely be the best freshman in the Big Ten. He is a potential all-league player, as is senior forward Juwan Morgan . They have some length and athleticism, giving them the kind of roster that head coach Archie Miller typically has success with. Point guard play is going to be a question mark, but at (+20,000), the Hoosiers were a great bet.\nThe problem is that Indiana is no longer (+20,000) to win the national title.\nAfter the Hoosiers landed Langford\u2019s commitment in late-April and Morgan announced that he was returning to school in late-May, their odds dropped all the way to (+4,000). That puts them at the 15th-most likely team to win the national title, at least according to the bookmakers at the Westgate.\nI\u2019ll pass.\nWICHITA STATE (+4,000) Simply put, this is just a terrible line, and not in the way that we want to exploit. Wichita State is a good program that has had success in the NCAA tournament in the past and the kind of name recognition that goes beyond their place in college basketball\u2019s hierarchy, but it would be (ahem) shocking if this was the year that the Shockers were to cut down the nets.\nThey lose nine of their top 11 scorers and 89 percent of their minutes played from last season, and none of the kids they have coming into the program this season are the kind of impact recruits that can dig them out of a rebuilding season. Gregg Marshall is Gregg Marshall, so anything is possible, but I will say that people around the AAC that I\u2019ve spoken to expect them to finish in the bottom four of their league standings .\nThere are only 14 teams with lower odds to win the title.\nI\u2019d take Wichita State (+4,000) to get a bid to the NCAA tournament. I don\u2019t know if there is a line that would get me to bet on them to win the national title.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/03/05/how-luke-yaklich-and-zavier-simpson-michigans-defensive-renaissance/", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/01/16/how-dukes-porous-defense-stacks-up-historically-with-past-title-winners/", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/01/17/what-can-kenpoms-efficiency-rankings-tell-us-about-this-years-title-contenders/", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/09/26/2018-2019-michigan-wolverines-basketball-preview/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HCLXa59TpC8hjgiPu4RegA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQxMy43NQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VeXZT2US23CIBGWE0n7TrA--~B/aD02NjI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/09dca7f767fac09c33e2abba3f6f4791", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/10/04/2018-19-american-preview-year-of-the-aac-rebuild/", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/10/05/2018-19-ucla-basketball-preview/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qDy.tis7BwcsTcFjr.nF8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTMwMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fSPLFB526QKqCbgw070bBA--~B/aD05MDk7dz0xOTIwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/310a9499f4bc3a6bcd9161ca1f5fe053", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/10/03/2018-2019-oregon-basketball-preview/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O2IX4OydD2wCAUF07zgJLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02MDUuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ngFX3uN9.gux5sEN00c2NQ--~B/aD05MDk7dz0xOTIwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/edfc56d1123f71d70e2384ff97251148", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/10/05/2018-19-ucla-basketball-preview/ncaa-basketball-tournament-first-four-dayton-7/", "http://www.nbcsports.com/", "https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/10/03/best-bets-which-longshot-national-title-futures-hold-value/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rob dauster", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "luke yaklich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john beilein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kenpom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westgate las vegas superbook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T21:02:51.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "527f91c7e6e4ce7b98af839c9abf35bc9ca69a00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WCzgYmNcOoQoaR8z14ZmQJOHKGWjHfUfkevoGpOBIWAOwjA.2pbPCVPkV.BQAejye_4kpIkgjzIK3WCUCFaUft7_uG0ltG2J6zn4ZX6A95nw-", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "CYCLING on Yahoo!

A trophy is important, but clearly what matters most are the amazing memories from this incredible summer \u2013 and no one can ever take those away.\"\nPinarello managing director Richard Hemington said he was devastated by the theft.\n\"We accept full responsibility and have personally apologized to Geraint,\" Hemington said. \"We hope that the trophy can be recovered.\"\nTeam Sky said police were investigating the matter and they were liaising with all relevant parties to agree on the best course of action to resolve the issue.\nThomas won the team's sixth Tour de France title in seven years in July.\nIt was the fourth successive grand tour win for the team after Chris Froome won the Tour and the Vuelta a Espana last year before clinching this year's Giro d'Italia.\n(Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KcSRxWZrJft86dRtuV1IrA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTkwMDtoPTU4Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8HLpMld4M_3nez1prdUbyQ--~B/aD0yOTE7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2018-10-10T082258Z_1_LYNXNPEE990JP_RTROPTP_2_CYCLING-FRANCE.JPG", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H4DQ0ES1QL6PJpz1l3bqmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQxMy44NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY3/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8HLpMld4M_3nez1prdUbyQ--~B/aD0yOTE7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2018-10-10T082258Z_1_LYNXNPEE990JP_RTROPTP_2_CYCLING-FRANCE.JPG", "http://www.reuters.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "team sky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geraint thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/stephane mahe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houilles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T13:28:38.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a63c13b701b720bc1c1466cc7618c1127511baed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WFrwp7CYmZx5mfRKf2yQgyPLCZtVYPP0XEl0OOaadeXsO.2QYXjDInuFdb5F5rsvl", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "NFL passing numbers are way, way up", "title_full": "NFL passing numbers are way, way up", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/arvhuxuq11OqWWjjwgvBFg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTk1Mzg5NjgxNjY4NQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GFRkyRfI0_NMLp.D1.vjrA--~B/aD01MTQ7dz05MTE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/a818f41c1252144401dfb1f330df2bce", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a63c13b701b720bc1c1466cc7618c1127511baed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WFrwp7CYmZx5mfRKf2yQgyPLCZtVYPP0XEl0OOaadeXsO.2QYXjDInuFdb5F5rsvl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "NFL passing numbers are way, way up", "text": "NFL passing numbers are way, way up Mike Florio ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports October 10, 2018, 12:09 AM GMT\nAt one point in the life cycle of this media outlet, we\u2019d periodically keep track of which quarterbacks were on the wrong side of the Kordoza Line \u2014 the career 70.7 passer rating of mostly-mediocre-with-flashes-of-really-good quarterback Kordell Stewart. Times have definitely changed.\nThis year, only one full-time starter is on the wrong side of the Kordoza Line: Bills rookie quarterback Josh Allen , who has a passer rating of 60.4. That\u2019s because plenty of quarterbacks are throwing the ball better than ever before.\nAccording to the NFL, the average passer rating currently is 93.4. (From 2002 through 2017, the average passer rating was 84.2.) Average completion percentage has moved to 65.0, and yards per attempt have spiked to 7.5.\nTotal yardage is up as well. From 1966 through 2017, the league saw 300-yard passing performances once every 3.8 games. This year, the average has fallen to once ever 1.4 games, with 57 300-yard performances in 78 games.\nEleven quarterbacks already have more than 1,500 passing yards. Six have thrown at least 12 touchdown passes through five weeks.\nTen starting quarterbacks has passer ratings higher than 100, with Saints quarterback Drew Brees racking up an eye-popping 122.3. Perhaps the best news for the NFL is that eight of those 10 are 30 or younger, with three of them 24 or younger.\nThat bodes very well for a future consisting of quality quarterbacks and, in turn, quality games. That\u2019s why the NFL is trying to keep all quarterbacks healthy. If the guy who is responsible for distributing the football can continue to do it at a high level, fans will be far more interested in pro football.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike florio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josh allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kordell stewart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nbc sports", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-10T03:16:22.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c54450c30b43d75449b4f922be7f8926a4e4db4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8Woet63J3ap0WTjIf6t6qQuMufWnCNXOh1xGhPcmJRjmDXZFUdtZcERTrTsi1MQk_2XyveTp9TPVtUe5__o7vTfA--", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Flyers' van Riemsdyk out 5-6 weeks with lower-body injury", "title_full": "Flyers' van Riemsdyk out 5-6 weeks with lower-body injury", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.084, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x.rLODsqioZXcvNb.93Uow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwMDI7aD0xMDI0/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oIfxM1mUCIMKTuPG5ywWeQ--~B/aD01MTI7dz01MDE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201810081207436397307", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c54450c30b43d75449b4f922be7f8926a4e4db4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8Woet63J3ap0WTjIf6t6qQuMufWnCNXOh1xGhPcmJRjmDXZFUdtZcERTrTsi1MQk_2XyveTp9TPVtUe5__o7vTfA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Flyers' van Riemsdyk out 5-6 weeks with lower-body injury", "text": "October 8, 2018, 5:09 PM GMT Sharks best positioned to withstand big early season injury FILE - In this Sept. 17, 2018, file photo, Philadelphia Flyers' James van Riemsdyk skates during an NHL preseason hockey game against the New York Islanders, in Philadelphia.

More Italy's winless run stretched to five games after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Ukraine at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris on Wednesday. Roberto Mancini started his Azzurri tenure with a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia in May but has failed to register another triumph since then \u2013 a run that has included away defeats to France and Portugal. After failing to break the deadlock during a dominant first-half display, Italy went ahead in the 55th minute when Federico Bernardeschi's long-range drive was inexplicably spilled into his own net by Andriy Pyatov. Ukraine, who had scarcely offered anything in the way of attacking threat prior to falling behind, secured a draw thanks to a volley from Ruslan Malinovskiy, who also saw a late free-kick cannon back off the crossbar. Pyatov's outing started in more positive fashion and he twice denied Italy in the opening stages, pawing away Bernardeschi's curling drive and then brilliantly repelling Leonardo Bonucci's hooked volley from 12 yards. Lorenzo Insigne clipped wide after being found inside the penalty area by Federico Chiesa midway through the first half before Pyatov tipped over Nicolo Barella's whipped effort from 25 yards. Italy were unable to make their superiority count before the interval as Pyatov once again denied them, this time pushing Chiesa's low drive past his right-hand post. However, Mancini's side took the lead their dominance deserved 10 minutes after the interval when Pyatov made a mess of Bernardeschi's attempt from distance. Out of nothing, the visitors pulled level seven minutes later when Malinovskiy's volley nestled in Gianluigi Donnarumma's bottom-left corner. Malinovskiy then thumped a stunning free-kick against the woodwork, while Donnarumma kept out Taras Stepanenko's header to at least make sure Mancini avoided a first defeat on home soil. What does it mean: Scale of Mancini's task now clear Mancini was expected to inject new life into Italian football after their humiliating failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, but it is not going according to plan for the former Manchester City boss. Ukraine, in contrast, look in far better shape and are now unbeaten in eight under the guidance of Andriy Shevchenko. Malinovskiy opens international account Italy looked to be on course for a deserved win before the Genk midfielder scored his first international goal with a composed finish. It could have got even better for the 25-year-old too, had his set-piece attempt in the closing stages found the net.

ARMAS (AP Sports Writer) October 11, 2018, 12:33 AM GMT 1 / 3 Loose Moose: Moustakas brings pivotal playoff experience Milwaukee Brewers' Mike Moustakas reacts after hitting an RBI single during the eighth inning of Game 2 of the National League Divisional Series baseball game against the Colorado Rockies Friday, Oct. 5, 2018, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Morry Gash)\nMILWAUKEE (AP) -- It sounds, at first, like a long, drawn out ''B !''\nBut look at the name on the scoreboard and it becomes apparent what fans at Miller Park are really chanting.\n''M se!''\nMike Moustakas has been a hit with fans and teammates with the Milwaukee Brewers since being acquired from the Kansas City Royals two-plus months ago. They appreciate his solid third base defense, and his left-handed power stroke was key in getting Milwaukee through the NL Division Series. In the clubhouse, his focused demeanor and extensive postseason experience have made him a source of steadiness for a club playing in the postseason for the first time since 2011.\n''Amazing, amazing. He's a great teammate,'' said utility man Hernan Perez, who has a locker near Moustakas. ''He's been in this situation.''\nMoustakas and current Brewers center fielder Lorenzo Cain helped Kansas City reach the World Series twice, including their championship run in 2015. Moustakas is one step away from a Series return with Milwaukee. Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers is Friday night at Miller Park.\nMoustakas hit .364 in a three-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS with two RBIs. He had a game-ending, two-out RBI single in the 10th inning in Game 1 and an RBI single in eighth inning of Game 2 to help break open what had been a 1-0 game.\nA cool hand in tense moments. Exactly what Milwaukee had in mind for its midseason acquisition.\n''The more experience that you can gain, the better off you're going to be,'' Moustakas said before a team workout on Wednesday.\nOverall, Moustakas is hitting .234 with six homers and 17 RBIs in 34 games over eight postseason series.\n''But his experience, it's important. It really is,'' manager Craig Counsell said last week. ''Making sure we don't put the result ahead of the process in our at-bats, and I think Moose is doing a heck of a job of that.'' Story Continues\nHis good friend Cain helped ease the transition to Milwaukee, but the Brewers also had to get creative to add Moustakas to the lineup, with Travis Shaw already on the team as the regular third baseman.\nSomeone had to move.\nShaw accepted a switch to second base, a new position and potentially awkward fit for the 230-pound slugger. The rationale was that the Brewers employ so many infield shifts, lining up at second wouldn't be a hard transition. Moustakas also volunteered to move over.\nShaw stuck at second and has played fairly well, allowing the Brewers to have three lefty bats in the lineup to go with MVP front-runner Christian Yelich.\n''It says volumes of the kind of player that he is and the kind of person he is,'' Moustakas said about Shaw. ''I think the unselfishness of him and this team is why I'm a good fit, because they let me come in here, play third. Just be myself and that's huge.''\nThe playoff run in Milwaukee winds down an eventful year for Moustakas that started with a disappointing offseason.\nAfter setting the Royals' single-season home run record with 38 in 2017, Moustakas filed for free agency. He rejected a $17.4 million qualifying offer in November.\nMoustakas never received the multiyear, mega-million dollar contract he and his agent Scott Boras had anticipated. The Royals signed Moustakas to a one-year, $6.5 million contract in March with a mutual option for 2019.\n''It's definitely been an interesting year, but I'm very happy with the way everything turned out,'' Moustakas said last week. ''I was able to sign back with Kansas City, I got traded here and now I'm in the postseason again. Everything happens for a reason. ... I'm just really happy to be here.''\nNOTE: Counsell said Wednesday he had yet to decide on the makeup of the starting rotation or pitching staff against the Dodgers. The Brewers used a bullpen game in the Game 1 win over Colorado in the NLDS. ''We have to think about this series differently and covering the number of innings we have to cover,'' he said.\n---\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports What to Read Next ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moustakas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike moustakas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kansas city royals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milwaukee brewers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado rockies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T09:23:27.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad10a70fe2bf233f2b357523d005ac78e5efc921", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W4gwUsrMw_1PGZtNtSJRchGaF3UqvmUJFF9dX1iDFN.ed.NVtSeejw3mqM6sgnyg1XbJfWlHrtR8CCAhHIfJzmg--", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "MLB: League should get cut from casino wagers on sport", "title_full": "MLB: League should get cut from casino wagers on sport", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9dCAUKi8f0bfR0U9uJV8UQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwMjQ7aD02NTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Btn6rf2qmr0JZ31CbysF9w--~B/aD0zMjU7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201810092106759730240", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad10a70fe2bf233f2b357523d005ac78e5efc921", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W4gwUsrMw_1PGZtNtSJRchGaF3UqvmUJFF9dX1iDFN.ed.NVtSeejw3mqM6sgnyg1XbJfWlHrtR8CCAhHIfJzmg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "MLB: League should get cut from casino wagers on sport", "text": "MLB: League should get cut from casino wagers on sport REGINA GARCIA CANO (Associated Press) October 10, 2018, 11:48 PM GMT MLB: League should get cut from casino wagers on sport Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Rick Porcello delivers against the New York Yankees during the first inning of Game 4 of baseball's American League Division Series, Tuesday, Oct. 9, 2018, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Major League Baseball and the casino industry are entrenched in their views on a league proposal to get a cut from wagers placed on the sport following the repeal of a federal ban on sports betting earlier this year.\nRepresentatives from both industries vigorously defended their believed right over the money wagered Wednesday during a panel at the casino industry's top trade show in Las Vegas. The MLB and other pro leagues haves asked for a percentage of the wagers, and casinos have strongly opposed any direct payments.\nKenny Gersh, the league's executive vice president of gaming, told the crowd of casino executives that a proposed 0.25 percent fee - which some have dubbed an ''integrity fee'' - is essentially a royalty that casino companies should pay if they are going to make money off of the sport. He defended it as a case of ''fairness'' and partnership with casino operators.\n''The state is going to designate these three, four, five very specific licensed entities: You guys get the right to make money from sports betting,'' he said. ''From a fairness perspective we think, if you are going to designate someone to be able to make money off of what at the end of the day is our sport and our events because if the Yankees weren't playing the Red Sox last night, you are not betting on the Yankees and the Red Sox ... we think we should be involved in that.''\nA U.S. Supreme Court decision in May allowed states to legalize sports betting. Sports books have since then opened in New Jersey, West Virginia and other states.\nProfessional sports leagues have failed so far to convince any state to build the fees into their laws. Nevada, which has offered sports betting for years, does not pay an integrity fee.\n''I mean, look, you want a cut of the revenue without any of the risk that's associated with it,'' Sara Slane, senior vice president of public affairs at the American Gaming Association, countered during the Global Gaming Expo. ''That's why we have to go through the regulatory process. We invest billions of dollars in buildings, in our licenses that cost us millions of dollars to go through. You want us to take that risk, pay you and then you are going to benefit on the back end as well ... What you guys are proposing is not financially viable.'' Story Continues\nThe only thing Gersh and Slane agreed during the panel is their enemy: Bookies on the corner and illegal offshore betting sites. The American Gaming Association, which is the largest lobbying group for the casino industry, has estimated that at least $150 billion a year is wagered illegally on sports betting in the U.S.\n---\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports What to Read Next ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "regina garcia cano", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kenny gersh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick porcello", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mlb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boston red sox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york yankees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo/julie jacobson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league baseball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T09:23:28.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c94770468d11d10aef903bb6d01a15101b20cedb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W0OJoF6uP8HeJGkNxb8nxVBTfGZhRa9dK.SeevB_JQAtSAdNS.14_bBkggtyPyLoGB2drzcTN97u.kweUcTLMng--", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Phil Neville takes referees to task after Australia draw", "title_full": "Phil Neville takes referees to task after Australia draw", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nrBBoB119FW_Oc4Q35.PSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EzHWuDZsA1k6t59LCYJq_Q--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e9ce787245deb6e940e917cc6c3ac7b1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c94770468d11d10aef903bb6d01a15101b20cedb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8W0OJoF6uP8HeJGkNxb8nxVBTfGZhRa9dK.SeevB_JQAtSAdNS.14_bBkggtyPyLoGB2drzcTN97u.kweUcTLMng--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Phil Neville takes referees to task after Australia draw", "text": "Yahoo Sport UK October 10, 2018, 11:25 AM GMT England Women boss Phil Neville warns referees to up their game as calls for VAR at Women\u2019s World Cup grow\nEngland manager Phil Neville could not resist taking the standard of refereeing to task on Tuesday night after his side were held to a contentious draw by Australia.\nFran Kirby was again on the scoresheet as England opened up a one-goal lead in the first half.\nAnd they could, and possibly should, have been further ahead but for having a goal wrongly disallowed and two controversial penalty calls that went again them.\nAnd in the end Clare Polkinghorne rose high to head home a leveller for the Matildas and peg back Neville\u2019s side.\nAnd with no VAR at next year\u2019s World Cup in France, Neville hopes the officiating will improve in time for the women\u2019s game to appear on the biggest stage of all.\n\u201cHaving VAR at the World Cup doesn\u2019t worry me, the standard of refereeing does and if we want to make the women\u2019s game absolute top, we\u2019re putting the players under immense pressure to challenge them to be better professionals and have better quality \u2013 every top country in the world is on the same pathway not just England and I see a performance like that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s my biggest concern. It is part and parcel of football. I played a game for United against Tottenham and Tottenham scored, Roy Carroll carried it into his own net and the game carried on. So it does happen I\u2019m not just saying it\u2019s the women\u2019s game it happens in both side but I just thought the referee\u2019s standard was below what it should be.\n\u201cThe second refereeing decision was a strange one because I\u2019m 40 yards away and the referee is 20 yards away and she\u2019s looked over at her assistant to ask if she could help her out when everybody in Fulham could see it was a penalty. It is a mystery.\u201d\nEngland, semi-finalists at the last World Cup and the last Euros \u2013 are ranked third in the world and qualified for France 2019 in unbeaten style. Story Continues\nBut Australia, the world no.6 side, pegged them back in the second half and Neville knows his side will need to be more clinical when it counts.\n\u201cIt was tough to take but at 70 minutes I thought, this could be 1-1,\u201d he added.\n\u201cMary Earps made some fantastic saves in the second half and it looked like we\u2019d lost a little bit of confidence in going to score that second and third goal. I think the two penalties, well I can\u2019t understand why they\u2019ve not been given. I mean if there were ever two clearer penalties in football, they were them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we got what we deserved but maybe that little bit of ruthlessness that we\u2019ve not had in the last two games, that (conceded) goal might do us good.\n\u201cThese last two games have been frustrating that the players who have worked so hard haven\u2019t got their just rewards by beating Brazil three or four-nil and Australia three or four-nil and that\u2019s not being disrespectful to both countries, who are really good teams and will do well in the World Cup, it is just on the balance of what I saw in both games that I should be going home tonight having won the game 4-1.\u201d What to Read Next ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil neville", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "clare polkinghorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fran kirby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yahoo sport uk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matildas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "var", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-10-11T01:34:40.027+03:00"}], "totalResults": 368, "moreResultsAvailable": 268, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=d0d26a65-a56f-413d-acc8-e54bafbb7377&format=json&ts=1539034515591&q=site_category%3Asports+language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+domain_rank%3A%3C100&sort=relevancy&from=100", "requestsLeft": 984}
